What are the Covid rules at Christmas?,"Restrictions will be temporarily eased around the UK, but there are still rules about what you can do.",https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-55056375,Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? - BBC News,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News At Christmas, coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Across the UK, people will be able to form ""bubbles"" of three households over a five-day period.  Between 23 and 27 December, the three households will be allowed to form a temporary ""Christmas bubble"". They can mix indoors and stay overnight. Northern Ireland has been granted a longer window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:  The bubbles will be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else. There will be no limit to the number of people in a household joining a bubble. However, the rules about what counts as a household will depend on where you are. In England if you have formed a support bubble with another household, that counts as one household, so you can join with two other households in a Christmas bubble. People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate. Travel restrictions will be lifted to allow people to visit their families anywhere in the UK.  But the government has warned that there will not be extra public transport laid on. It has urged people to plan their travel in advance. You will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues. You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying. Places you can meet include parks, beaches, open countryside, public gardens, allotments and playgrounds. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation of restrictions will not be extended to cover New Year's Eve. She said: ""I know New Year is special for people, perhaps slightly more so in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, but the virus is still there."" The virus will not call a truce because it is Christmas, and will be as contagious as at any other time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Even if it is within the rules, meeting friends and family over Christmas will be a ""personal judgement"", the government says. People should consider the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to use the Christmas rules responsibly and ""only if you think it is necessary"". Children of parents who live apart are allowed to be part of two separate Christmas bubbles. This means they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students may return to their parents in the early December ""travel window"" and be counted as part of their household straight away. But if parents have three or more grown-up children who are not at university, then they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents. Individual households can split for Christmas. So, if three people are sharing a home, they can all go and form separate Christmas bubbles with their families and come back to form a single household again afterwards.  In England, care home residents have been told not to take part in Christmas bubbles, while visits out of the home should only be considered by residents who are of ""working age"". This is because of the increased risk of the resident catching coronavirus, and spreading it to other vulnerable people when they return, the government says. People are asked to consider whether visiting at the care home would ""provide meaningful contact in a safer way"", while residents who do leave will be tested and asked to isolate when they return.

How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas,Christmas could be a dangerous time to contract the virus - but precautions can be taken.,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-55017034,Covid: How to keep the virus at bay this Christmas - BBC News,"By David ShukmanBBC science editor Christmas is coming but how can you celebrate it without giving the unwelcome gift of coronavirus? Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. Unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. So here are the key questions to ask about any festivities.  No-one will be popular for saying this, but the evidence is clear - the larger the group, the greater the risk.  If it was summer and we could meet outside, where the virus gets dispersed in fresh air, it would be less of a problem. But it's winter, so everyone's inside.  And the more people who are involved, the greater the likelihood that someone may be a carrier of the virus - maybe without realising.  A study by Sage, the government's science advisory panel, concludes that if you double the number of people getting together, you get a fourfold increase in the odds of infection.  It also matters how many different households are meeting - the fewer the safer - because the more different homes which are mixing, the greater the potential for the virus to spread.   Passing around dishes and bottles, encouraging everyone to tuck in, is one of the most natural of instincts at Christmas. But the coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts.  In the US, the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners is to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Amid the excitement of reunions, it's perfectly normal for voices to be raised.  Add a little alcohol, and maybe have a TV or music on as well, and things get even noisier. But if someone is infected, the louder they speak, the more virus they release.  A lot of research shows that when voices are projected, people emit more tiny droplets of the kind that can carry the coronavirus. That's why for Thanksgiving gatherings, the US government advises: ""Encourage guests to avoid singing or shouting, especially indoors.  ""Keep music levels down so people don't have to shout or speak loudly to be heard."" Maybe the safest option is to hum Silent Night. Popping in for a quick visit is safer than lingering over dinner for several hours.  Researchers say an event's duration has a big impact on the infection risk. In March, more than 50 members of a choir in the US were confirmed or suspected of being infected, after a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal session.  Scientists reckoned that if it had lasted less than an hour, the number of infections would have been reduced by more than half.    Prof Cath Noakes, one of the study's authors, says the problem is that tiny particles carrying the virus, known as aerosols, can accumulate in the air.   ""There is growing evidence that if you're in a poorly-ventilated space for a long period of time with people who are infected, you may breathe in those aerosols and that might be one of the routes of infection,"" she said. The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A Sage report says infection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And in this context, ""ventilation"" doesn't mean having fans blowing the air around, but a flow of air from outside. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. According to Prof Noakes, people must dream up creative new options for Christmas That could range from meeting virtually on Zoom, going for a walk, braving the weather for a picnic, or even delaying big gatherings until next summer.  If you are planning a meal indoors, she says, make sure you keep everyone as far apart as possible and be careful to keep everything clean. Also try to avoid having people from different households sitting opposite each other because speaking face-to-face is a route of transmission. Any social setting increases the risk of infection, says Prof Noakes, and we will have to compromise, reduce our contacts with people and do things in a different way. ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas,"" she says. ""It's just a virus and it thrives on human contact.""

Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for,The Spending Review marks the start of the chancellor's economic recovery strategy. Here's what to watch for.,https://www.bbc.com//news/business-55043908,Rishi Sunak's Spending Review: Four things to look out for - BBC News,"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak begins setting out plans for what he hopes will be an economy beyond Covid-19.  This Spending Review - detailing the money government departments will get for things like the NHS, education, roads, and police - only covers the financial year 2021-22. It will also set out money for the devolved administrations Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In normal times, reviews cover three or four years. But such is the economic uncertainty that this look-ahead has been limited to the next 12 months.  Even so, Mr Sunak will point to the direction of travel for spending (and possibly tax rises) for future years. Few reviews can have been so anticipated. Here's what to watch out for. The economic shock has left the UK poorer. By the end of this year the economy is expected to be at least 10% smaller than pre-pandemic.  Alongside the Spending Review, Mr Sunak will disclose latest forecasts for the economy and public finances from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Earlier this year, the OBR forecast a 13% contraction. While it is not expected to be that bad, the shrinkage will still likely be in the double-digits, and with public borrowing topping £350bn - something not seen in peacetime.  A difficulty for the chancellor is that big tranches of public service spending have already been made. Despite that, some areas will reportedly get more: NHS England, schools and defence. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), some two-thirds of public service spending has been pre-determined.  The key question is whether the remaining third is enough to go round. The answer is almost certainly not. The IFS thinks ""unprotected"" services such as the courts, prisons or local government are vulnerable to cuts. The overseas aid budget is also in the line of fire. Saving, not spending, will dominate Wednesday's agenda. And one of the biggest savings could be a public sector pay freeze. It would be hugely controversial. Media leaks last week claimed Mr Sunak wants a freeze for everyone except frontline NHS staff.  That won't go down well with the police, teachers, civil servants or anyone who thinks they've done their bit to ensure the public sector keeps going in tough times. Even a return to a 1% cap is likely to be fiercely resisted. Some commentators think the media reports were Treasury kite-flying. Even so, in the summer, Mr Sunak suggested that as private sector pay had taken a huge hit, in the ""interest of fairness"" the public sector's 5.4 million workers should share some pain. Trouble is, relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay has fallen to its lowest level in decades, according to the IFS.  Only during the pandemic has public sector pay performed more strongly than in the private sector. Union leaders have already warned of industrial action to ensure members' pay does not fall further behind.  Many promises have been thrown off-course because of the pandemic, and the government will be keen to get its north-south levelling up agenda back on track as soon as possible. Infrastructure spending is key to this.  The north has long complained that the Treasury methodology used to calculate the cost-benefit of spending money on big projects is inherently biased towards London and the rest of the south east. So, expect some changes to these calculations. And watch out for whether any spending promises are new money, or simply projects brought forward. To underline his commitment to spend on big long-term projects, there is talk that Mr Sunak could publish details of a National Infrastructure Strategy and a Research and Development Strategy.   And in a symbolic move that levelling up is more than a question of infrastructure, the Financial Times has reported that the chancellor could also announce that parts of government could relocate from the capital - with the Treasury leading the way. While Wednesday will be about spending and borrowing, at some point the chancellor will have to decide how it will be paid for. He will start to address this in next March's Budget, although most economic commentators feel the economy will still be too fragile for major tax rises. It is possible that, with the success of a Covid vaccine, the economy could bounce back, limiting the need for big rises. However, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC that four or five years down the road he still expects the economy to be about 4%-5% smaller than before the pandemic. Rein in spending and raise taxes too early, and recovery will be choked off. Leave it too late, and the public finances will spin out of control.  ""It's a fine judgement,"" said Mr Johnson. Both the chancellor and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have, however, said they don't want a return to austerity.  There have been reports the Treasury could raise money from changes to Capital Gains Tax, pensions relief or self-employment taxes. But this is tinkering.  Mr Johnson believes £40bn of tax rises are necessary over the short-term, and that sort of money cannot be raised without touching the Big Three: income tax, VAT or national insurance. These bring in almost two-thirds of government revenue. Spending Review: What is it and how does it affect me?

What will England's new lockdown rules be?,England will move to a tougher version of tiered coronavirus restrictions when lockdown ends next week.,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-52530518,"Covid: The new lockdown rules for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - BBC News","Plans to allow a temporary easing of Covid restrictions at Christmas have been announced.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also set out plans for the end of lockdown in England, and a return to a tougher three-tier system of restrictions. Between 23 and 27 December, up to three households will be allowed to form a temporary ""Christmas bubble"" and mix indoors. Northern Ireland has been granted a longer window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:  People are not allowed meet their Christmas bubble in hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or at entertainment venues. England's current lockdown will end just after midnight on Wednesday 2 December. After that, the following will apply to all areas: There will be different rules for pubs and spectator sports in the different tiers. For pubs: Spectator sports: The government will announce on 26 November which areas are in which tiers. This will be formally reviewed every 14 days.  More details of the plan are here. As before, you can only meet people from other households in a group of up to six. Rules about where you can do so apply. Only those in tier one areas will be able to meet people they don't live with indoors. People in tier two can't socialise with other households indoors. Those in tier three can't mix with other households indoors, or in private and pub gardens. There are exceptions for childcare and support bubbles. People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas. Going to work or school Exercise Shops, pubs and other venues Worship, weddings and funerals Northern Ireland will go into a two-week circuit-break lockdown from 00:01 GMT on Friday 27 November. However, some other restrictions will be eased until then. Currently:  From Friday 27 November: Read Northern Ireland's official guidance. Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.  Eleven local authority areas in west and central Scotland have recently moved from level three to level four, affecting two million people. The areas are: City of Glasgow, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire, West Dunbartonshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the level four measures would be lifted on Friday 11 December.  East Lothian and Midlothian will move down from level three to level two on Tuesday 24 November. Schools stay open in all levels. People living in level three or level four must not travel outside their own council area, except for certain essential purposes. Those living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, apart from limited exceptional circumstances.  There must also be no non-essential travel between Scotland the rest of the UK. Lockdown restrictions in Wales were eased on 9 November.  The current rules say: People who you don't live with still cannot come into your home socially, unless you are in an extended household (bubble) with them. Tradespeople can enter your home to carry out work. Read Wales' official guidance. Do you meet other people for exercise? Have you been out walking during the November lockdown?

Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?,Good fortune and scientific brilliance were behind the Covid-19 vaccine being developed so quickly.,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-55041371,Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? - BBC News,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Ten years' vaccine work achieved in about 10 months. Yet no corners cut in designing, testing and manufacturing. They are two statements that sound like a contradiction, and have led some to ask how we can be sure the Oxford vaccine - which has published its first results showing it is highly effective at stopping Covid-19 - is safe when it has been made so fast.  So, this is the real story of how the Oxford vaccine happened so quickly.  It is one that relies on good fortune as well as scientific brilliance; has origins in both a deadly Ebola outbreak and a chimpanzee's runny nose; and sees the researchers go from having no money in the bank to chartering private planes.  The biggest misconception is the work on the vaccine started when the pandemic began.  The world's biggest Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016 was a catastrophe. The response was too slow and 11,000 people died.  ""The world should have done better,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, the architect of the Oxford vaccine, told me.   In the recriminations that followed, a plan emerged for how to tackle the next big one. At the end of a list of known threats was ""Disease X"" - the sinister name of a new, unknown infection that would take the world by surprise.  The Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford - named after the scientist that performed the first vaccination in 1796, and now home to some of the world's leading experts - designed a strategy for defeating an unknown enemy.  ""We were planning how can we go really quickly to have a vaccine in someone in the shortest possible time,"" Prof Gilbert said.  ""We hadn't got the plan finished, but we did do pretty well."" The central piece of their plan was a revolutionary style of vaccine known as ""plug and play"". It has two highly desirable traits for facing the unknown - it is both fast and flexible.  Conventional vaccines - including the whole of the childhood immunisation programme - use a killed or weakened form of the original infection, or inject fragments of it into the body. But these are slow to develop.   Instead the Oxford researchers constructed ChAdOx1 - or Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford One. Scientists took a common cold virus that infected chimpanzees and engineered it to become the building block of a vaccine against almost anything.  Before Covid, 330 people had been given ChAdOx1 based-vaccines for diseases ranging from flu to Zika virus, and prostate cancer to the tropical disease chikungunya. The virus from chimps is genetically modified so it cannot cause an infection in people. It can then be modified again to contain the genetic blueprints for whatever you want to train the immune system to attack. This target is known is an antigen.  ChAdOx1 is in essence a sophisticated, microscopic postman. All the scientists have to do is change the package. ""We drop it in and off we go,"" said Prof Gilbert. While much of the world was having a lie-in after New Year's Eve, Prof Gilbert noticed concerning reports of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan, China. Within two weeks scientists had identified the virus responsible and began to suspect it was able to spread between people.  ""We'd been planning for disease X, we'd been waiting for disease X, and I thought this could be it,"" Prof Gilbert said. At this point, the team did not know how important their work would become. It started out as a test of how fast they could go and as a demonstration of the ChAdOx1 technology. Prof Gilbert said: ""I thought it might only have been a project, we'd make the vaccine and the virus would fizzle out. But it didn't."" It sounds strange to say it, almost perverse, but it was lucky that the pandemic was caused by a coronavirus.  This family of viruses had tried to jump from animals to people twice before in the past 20 years - Sars coronavirus in 2002 and Mers coronavirus in 2012. It meant scientists knew the virus's biology, how it behaved and its Achilles heel - the ""spike protein"". ""We had a huge head start,"" Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford team said. The spike protein is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. If a vaccine could train the immune system to attack the spike, then the team knew they were odds-on to succeed. And they had already developed a ChAdOx1 vaccine for Mers, which could train the immune system to spot the spike. The Oxford team were not starting from scratch.   ""If this had been a completely unknown virus, then we'd have been in a very different position,"" Prof Pollard added.  It was also lucky that coronaviruses cause short-term infections. It means the body is capable of beating the virus and a vaccine just needs to tap into that natural process.  If it had been a long-term or chronic infection that the body cannot beat - like HIV - then it's unlikely a vaccine could work.  On 11 January, Chinese scientists published and shared with the world the full genetic code of the coronavirus. The team now had everything they needed to make a Covid-19 vaccine.  All they had to do was slip the genetic instructions for the spike protein into ChAdOx1 and they were good to go. Making a vaccine is very expensive.  ""The first bit was quite painful. There was a period when we didn't have any money in the bank,"" said Prof Pollard.  They had some funding from the university, but they had a crucial advantage over other groups around the world.  On the site of Churchill hospital in Oxford is the group's own vaccine manufacturing plant.  ""We could say stop everything else and make this vaccine,"" said Prof Pollard. It was enough to get going, but not to make the thousands of doses needed for larger trials.  ""Getting money was my main activity until April, just trying to persuade people to fund it now,"" said Prof Gilbert.  But as the pandemic tightened its grip on the world and country after country descended into lockdown, the money started to flow. Production of the vaccine moved to a facility in Italy and the money helped solve problems that would have otherwise held up the trials, including the logistical nightmare of lockdown Europe. ""At one point we had to charter a plane, the vaccine was in Italy and we had clinics here the next morning,"" said Prof Gilbert.  Quality control is never the sexiest part of a project, but researchers cannot start giving an experimental vaccine to people until they are sure it has been made to a high enough standard.  At every stage of the manufacturing process, they needed to ensure the vaccine was not being contaminated with viruses or bacteria. In the past this had been a lengthy process.  ""If we had not been thinking about how to shorten the time, we might have had a vaccine in March but not started trials until June.""  Instead, once animal trials had shown the vaccine was safe, the researchers were able to begin human trials of the vaccine on 23 April.  Since then the Oxford vaccine has been through every stage of trials that would normally take place for a vaccine.  There is a pattern to clinical trials: The Oxford vaccine has been through each of those stages, including 30,000 volunteers in the phase three trial, and the team has as much data as any other vaccine trial. What hasn't happened is years of hanging around in between each phase.  Dr Mark Toshner, who has been involved in the trials at sites in Cambridge, said the idea that it took 10 years to trial a vaccine was misleading. He told the BBC: ""Most of the time, it's a lot of nothing.""  He describes it as a process of writing grant applications, having them rejected, writing them again, getting approval to do the trial, negotiating with manufacturers, and trying to recruit enough people to take part. It can take years to get from one phase to the next.  ""The process is long, not because it needs to be and not because it's safe, but because of the real world,"" Dr Toshner said. Safety has not been sacrificed. Instead the unparalleled scientific push to make the trials happen, the droves of people willing to take part, and of course the money blew many of the usual hold-ups aside.  That does not mean problems will not appear in the future - medical research cannot make those guarantees. Usually, side-effects of vaccines appear either at the time they are given or a few months afterwards. It is possible that rarer problems could emerge when millions of people are immunised, but this is true of every vaccine that has ever been developed.  Plans for giving regulatory approval and manufacturing the vaccine have also been dramatically speeded up.  The UK already has four million doses of the vaccine ready to deploy. The Oxford team partnered with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, and the manufacture of the vaccine started long before the results came in. At the time it was a gamble, but it has paid off big time.  Regulators, who would normally wait until after the trials were concluded, have also been involved early. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK has been conducting ""rolling reviews"" of the safety, manufacturing standards and effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine. It means a decision on whether the vaccine can be used will come early.  The Oxford vaccine has - like those of Pfizer and Moderna - arrived in record time to a world in desperate need.

What are the Covid rules at Christmas?,"Restrictions will be temporarily eased around the UK, but there are still rules about what you can do.",https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-55056375,Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? - BBC News,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News At Christmas, coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Across the UK, people will be able to form ""bubbles"" of three households over a five-day period.  Between 23 and 27 December, the three households will be allowed to form a temporary ""Christmas bubble"". They can mix indoors and stay overnight. Northern Ireland has been granted a longer window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:  The bubbles will be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else. There will be no limit to the number of people in a household joining a bubble. However, the rules about what counts as a household will depend on where you are. In England if you have formed a support bubble with another household, that counts as one household, so you can join with two other households in a Christmas bubble. People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate. Travel restrictions will be lifted to allow people to visit their families anywhere in the UK.  But the government has warned that there will not be extra public transport laid on. It has urged people to plan their travel in advance. You will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues. You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying. Places you can meet include parks, beaches, open countryside, public gardens, allotments and playgrounds. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation of restrictions will not be extended to cover New Year's Eve. She said: ""I know New Year is special for people, perhaps slightly more so in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, but the virus is still there."" The virus will not call a truce because it is Christmas, and will be as contagious as at any other time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Even if it is within the rules, meeting friends and family over Christmas will be a ""personal judgement"", the government says. People should consider the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to use the Christmas rules responsibly and ""only if you think it is necessary"". Children of parents who live apart are allowed to be part of two separate Christmas bubbles. This means they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students may return to their parents in the early December ""travel window"" and be counted as part of their household straight away. But if parents have three or more grown-up children who are not at university, then they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents. Individual households can split for Christmas. So, if three people are sharing a home, they can all go and form separate Christmas bubbles with their families and come back to form a single household again afterwards.  In England, care home residents have been told not to take part in Christmas bubbles, while visits out of the home should only be considered by residents who are of ""working age"". This is because of the increased risk of the resident catching coronavirus, and spreading it to other vulnerable people when they return, the government says. People are asked to consider whether visiting at the care home would ""provide meaningful contact in a safer way"", while residents who do leave will be tested and asked to isolate when they return.

How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas,Christmas could be a dangerous time to contract the virus - but precautions can be taken.,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-55017034,Covid: How to keep the virus at bay this Christmas - BBC News,"By David ShukmanBBC science editor Christmas is coming but how can you celebrate it without giving the unwelcome gift of coronavirus? Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. Unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. So here are the key questions to ask about any festivities.  No-one will be popular for saying this, but the evidence is clear - the larger the group, the greater the risk.  If it was summer and we could meet outside, where the virus gets dispersed in fresh air, it would be less of a problem. But it's winter, so everyone's inside.  And the more people who are involved, the greater the likelihood that someone may be a carrier of the virus - maybe without realising.  A study by Sage, the government's science advisory panel, concludes that if you double the number of people getting together, you get a fourfold increase in the odds of infection.  It also matters how many different households are meeting - the fewer the safer - because the more different homes which are mixing, the greater the potential for the virus to spread.   Passing around dishes and bottles, encouraging everyone to tuck in, is one of the most natural of instincts at Christmas. But the coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts.  In the US, the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners is to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Amid the excitement of reunions, it's perfectly normal for voices to be raised.  Add a little alcohol, and maybe have a TV or music on as well, and things get even noisier. But if someone is infected, the louder they speak, the more virus they release.  A lot of research shows that when voices are projected, people emit more tiny droplets of the kind that can carry the coronavirus. That's why for Thanksgiving gatherings, the US government advises: ""Encourage guests to avoid singing or shouting, especially indoors.  ""Keep music levels down so people don't have to shout or speak loudly to be heard."" Maybe the safest option is to hum Silent Night. Popping in for a quick visit is safer than lingering over dinner for several hours.  Researchers say an event's duration has a big impact on the infection risk. In March, more than 50 members of a choir in the US were confirmed or suspected of being infected, after a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal session.  Scientists reckoned that if it had lasted less than an hour, the number of infections would have been reduced by more than half.    Prof Cath Noakes, one of the study's authors, says the problem is that tiny particles carrying the virus, known as aerosols, can accumulate in the air.   ""There is growing evidence that if you're in a poorly-ventilated space for a long period of time with people who are infected, you may breathe in those aerosols and that might be one of the routes of infection,"" she said. The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A Sage report says infection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And in this context, ""ventilation"" doesn't mean having fans blowing the air around, but a flow of air from outside. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. According to Prof Noakes, people must dream up creative new options for Christmas That could range from meeting virtually on Zoom, going for a walk, braving the weather for a picnic, or even delaying big gatherings until next summer.  If you are planning a meal indoors, she says, make sure you keep everyone as far apart as possible and be careful to keep everything clean. Also try to avoid having people from different households sitting opposite each other because speaking face-to-face is a route of transmission. Any social setting increases the risk of infection, says Prof Noakes, and we will have to compromise, reduce our contacts with people and do things in a different way. ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas,"" she says. ""It's just a virus and it thrives on human contact.""

Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for,,https://www.bbc.com//news/business-55043908,Rishi Sunak's Spending Review: Four things to look out for - BBC News,"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak begins setting out plans for what he hopes will be an economy beyond Covid-19.  This Spending Review - detailing the money government departments will get for things like the NHS, education, roads, and police - only covers the financial year 2021-22. It will also set out money for the devolved administrations Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In normal times, reviews cover three or four years. But such is the economic uncertainty that this look-ahead has been limited to the next 12 months.  Even so, Mr Sunak will point to the direction of travel for spending (and possibly tax rises) for future years. Few reviews can have been so anticipated. Here's what to watch out for. The economic shock has left the UK poorer. By the end of this year the economy is expected to be at least 10% smaller than pre-pandemic.  Alongside the Spending Review, Mr Sunak will disclose latest forecasts for the economy and public finances from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Earlier this year, the OBR forecast a 13% contraction. While it is not expected to be that bad, the shrinkage will still likely be in the double-digits, and with public borrowing topping £350bn - something not seen in peacetime.  A difficulty for the chancellor is that big tranches of public service spending have already been made. Despite that, some areas will reportedly get more: NHS England, schools and defence. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), some two-thirds of public service spending has been pre-determined.  The key question is whether the remaining third is enough to go round. The answer is almost certainly not. The IFS thinks ""unprotected"" services such as the courts, prisons or local government are vulnerable to cuts. The overseas aid budget is also in the line of fire. Saving, not spending, will dominate Wednesday's agenda. And one of the biggest savings could be a public sector pay freeze. It would be hugely controversial. Media leaks last week claimed Mr Sunak wants a freeze for everyone except frontline NHS staff.  That won't go down well with the police, teachers, civil servants or anyone who thinks they've done their bit to ensure the public sector keeps going in tough times. Even a return to a 1% cap is likely to be fiercely resisted. Some commentators think the media reports were Treasury kite-flying. Even so, in the summer, Mr Sunak suggested that as private sector pay had taken a huge hit, in the ""interest of fairness"" the public sector's 5.4 million workers should share some pain. Trouble is, relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay has fallen to its lowest level in decades, according to the IFS.  Only during the pandemic has public sector pay performed more strongly than in the private sector. Union leaders have already warned of industrial action to ensure members' pay does not fall further behind.  Many promises have been thrown off-course because of the pandemic, and the government will be keen to get its north-south levelling up agenda back on track as soon as possible. Infrastructure spending is key to this.  The north has long complained that the Treasury methodology used to calculate the cost-benefit of spending money on big projects is inherently biased towards London and the rest of the south east. So, expect some changes to these calculations. And watch out for whether any spending promises are new money, or simply projects brought forward. To underline his commitment to spend on big long-term projects, there is talk that Mr Sunak could publish details of a National Infrastructure Strategy and a Research and Development Strategy.   And in a symbolic move that levelling up is more than a question of infrastructure, the Financial Times has reported that the chancellor could also announce that parts of government could relocate from the capital - with the Treasury leading the way. While Wednesday will be about spending and borrowing, at some point the chancellor will have to decide how it will be paid for. He will start to address this in next March's Budget, although most economic commentators feel the economy will still be too fragile for major tax rises. It is possible that, with the success of a Covid vaccine, the economy could bounce back, limiting the need for big rises. However, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC that four or five years down the road he still expects the economy to be about 4%-5% smaller than before the pandemic. Rein in spending and raise taxes too early, and recovery will be choked off. Leave it too late, and the public finances will spin out of control.  ""It's a fine judgement,"" said Mr Johnson. Both the chancellor and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have, however, said they don't want a return to austerity.  There have been reports the Treasury could raise money from changes to Capital Gains Tax, pensions relief or self-employment taxes. But this is tinkering.  Mr Johnson believes £40bn of tax rises are necessary over the short-term, and that sort of money cannot be raised without touching the Big Three: income tax, VAT or national insurance. These bring in almost two-thirds of government revenue. Spending Review: What is it and how does it affect me?

What will England's new lockdown rules be?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-52530518,"Covid: The new lockdown rules for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - BBC News","Plans to allow a temporary easing of Covid restrictions at Christmas have been announced.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also set out plans for the end of lockdown in England, and a return to a tougher three-tier system of restrictions. Between 23 and 27 December, up to three households will be allowed to form a temporary ""Christmas bubble"" and mix indoors. Northern Ireland has been granted a longer window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:  People are not allowed meet their Christmas bubble in hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or at entertainment venues. England's current lockdown will end just after midnight on Wednesday 2 December. After that, the following will apply to all areas: There will be different rules for pubs and spectator sports in the different tiers. For pubs: Spectator sports: The government will announce on 26 November which areas are in which tiers. This will be formally reviewed every 14 days.  More details of the plan are here. As before, you can only meet people from other households in a group of up to six. Rules about where you can do so apply. Only those in tier one areas will be able to meet people they don't live with indoors. People in tier two can't socialise with other households indoors. Those in tier three can't mix with other households indoors, or in private and pub gardens. There are exceptions for childcare and support bubbles. People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas. Going to work or school Exercise Shops, pubs and other venues Worship, weddings and funerals Northern Ireland will go into a two-week circuit-break lockdown from 00:01 GMT on Friday 27 November. However, some other restrictions will be eased until then. Currently:  From Friday 27 November: Read Northern Ireland's official guidance. Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.  Eleven local authority areas in west and central Scotland have recently moved from level three to level four, affecting two million people. The areas are: City of Glasgow, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire, West Dunbartonshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the level four measures would be lifted on Friday 11 December.  East Lothian and Midlothian will move down from level three to level two on Tuesday 24 November. Schools stay open in all levels. People living in level three or level four must not travel outside their own council area, except for certain essential purposes. Those living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, apart from limited exceptional circumstances.  There must also be no non-essential travel between Scotland the rest of the UK. Lockdown restrictions in Wales were eased on 9 November.  The current rules say: People who you don't live with still cannot come into your home socially, unless you are in an extended household (bubble) with them. Tradespeople can enter your home to carry out work. Read Wales' official guidance. Do you meet other people for exercise? Have you been out walking during the November lockdown?

Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-55041371,Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? - BBC News,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Ten years' vaccine work achieved in about 10 months. Yet no corners cut in designing, testing and manufacturing. They are two statements that sound like a contradiction, and have led some to ask how we can be sure the Oxford vaccine - which has published its first results showing it is highly effective at stopping Covid-19 - is safe when it has been made so fast.  So, this is the real story of how the Oxford vaccine happened so quickly.  It is one that relies on good fortune as well as scientific brilliance; has origins in both a deadly Ebola outbreak and a chimpanzee's runny nose; and sees the researchers go from having no money in the bank to chartering private planes.  The biggest misconception is the work on the vaccine started when the pandemic began.  The world's biggest Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016 was a catastrophe. The response was too slow and 11,000 people died.  ""The world should have done better,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, the architect of the Oxford vaccine, told me.   In the recriminations that followed, a plan emerged for how to tackle the next big one. At the end of a list of known threats was ""Disease X"" - the sinister name of a new, unknown infection that would take the world by surprise.  The Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford - named after the scientist that performed the first vaccination in 1796, and now home to some of the world's leading experts - designed a strategy for defeating an unknown enemy.  ""We were planning how can we go really quickly to have a vaccine in someone in the shortest possible time,"" Prof Gilbert said.  ""We hadn't got the plan finished, but we did do pretty well."" The central piece of their plan was a revolutionary style of vaccine known as ""plug and play"". It has two highly desirable traits for facing the unknown - it is both fast and flexible.  Conventional vaccines - including the whole of the childhood immunisation programme - use a killed or weakened form of the original infection, or inject fragments of it into the body. But these are slow to develop.   Instead the Oxford researchers constructed ChAdOx1 - or Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford One. Scientists took a common cold virus that infected chimpanzees and engineered it to become the building block of a vaccine against almost anything.  Before Covid, 330 people had been given ChAdOx1 based-vaccines for diseases ranging from flu to Zika virus, and prostate cancer to the tropical disease chikungunya. The virus from chimps is genetically modified so it cannot cause an infection in people. It can then be modified again to contain the genetic blueprints for whatever you want to train the immune system to attack. This target is known is an antigen.  ChAdOx1 is in essence a sophisticated, microscopic postman. All the scientists have to do is change the package. ""We drop it in and off we go,"" said Prof Gilbert. While much of the world was having a lie-in after New Year's Eve, Prof Gilbert noticed concerning reports of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan, China. Within two weeks scientists had identified the virus responsible and began to suspect it was able to spread between people.  ""We'd been planning for disease X, we'd been waiting for disease X, and I thought this could be it,"" Prof Gilbert said. At this point, the team did not know how important their work would become. It started out as a test of how fast they could go and as a demonstration of the ChAdOx1 technology. Prof Gilbert said: ""I thought it might only have been a project, we'd make the vaccine and the virus would fizzle out. But it didn't."" It sounds strange to say it, almost perverse, but it was lucky that the pandemic was caused by a coronavirus.  This family of viruses had tried to jump from animals to people twice before in the past 20 years - Sars coronavirus in 2002 and Mers coronavirus in 2012. It meant scientists knew the virus's biology, how it behaved and its Achilles heel - the ""spike protein"". ""We had a huge head start,"" Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford team said. The spike protein is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. If a vaccine could train the immune system to attack the spike, then the team knew they were odds-on to succeed. And they had already developed a ChAdOx1 vaccine for Mers, which could train the immune system to spot the spike. The Oxford team were not starting from scratch.   ""If this had been a completely unknown virus, then we'd have been in a very different position,"" Prof Pollard added.  It was also lucky that coronaviruses cause short-term infections. It means the body is capable of beating the virus and a vaccine just needs to tap into that natural process.  If it had been a long-term or chronic infection that the body cannot beat - like HIV - then it's unlikely a vaccine could work.  On 11 January, Chinese scientists published and shared with the world the full genetic code of the coronavirus. The team now had everything they needed to make a Covid-19 vaccine.  All they had to do was slip the genetic instructions for the spike protein into ChAdOx1 and they were good to go. Making a vaccine is very expensive.  ""The first bit was quite painful. There was a period when we didn't have any money in the bank,"" said Prof Pollard.  They had some funding from the university, but they had a crucial advantage over other groups around the world.  On the site of Churchill hospital in Oxford is the group's own vaccine manufacturing plant.  ""We could say stop everything else and make this vaccine,"" said Prof Pollard. It was enough to get going, but not to make the thousands of doses needed for larger trials.  ""Getting money was my main activity until April, just trying to persuade people to fund it now,"" said Prof Gilbert.  But as the pandemic tightened its grip on the world and country after country descended into lockdown, the money started to flow. Production of the vaccine moved to a facility in Italy and the money helped solve problems that would have otherwise held up the trials, including the logistical nightmare of lockdown Europe. ""At one point we had to charter a plane, the vaccine was in Italy and we had clinics here the next morning,"" said Prof Gilbert.  Quality control is never the sexiest part of a project, but researchers cannot start giving an experimental vaccine to people until they are sure it has been made to a high enough standard.  At every stage of the manufacturing process, they needed to ensure the vaccine was not being contaminated with viruses or bacteria. In the past this had been a lengthy process.  ""If we had not been thinking about how to shorten the time, we might have had a vaccine in March but not started trials until June.""  Instead, once animal trials had shown the vaccine was safe, the researchers were able to begin human trials of the vaccine on 23 April.  Since then the Oxford vaccine has been through every stage of trials that would normally take place for a vaccine.  There is a pattern to clinical trials: The Oxford vaccine has been through each of those stages, including 30,000 volunteers in the phase three trial, and the team has as much data as any other vaccine trial. What hasn't happened is years of hanging around in between each phase.  Dr Mark Toshner, who has been involved in the trials at sites in Cambridge, said the idea that it took 10 years to trial a vaccine was misleading. He told the BBC: ""Most of the time, it's a lot of nothing.""  He describes it as a process of writing grant applications, having them rejected, writing them again, getting approval to do the trial, negotiating with manufacturers, and trying to recruit enough people to take part. It can take years to get from one phase to the next.  ""The process is long, not because it needs to be and not because it's safe, but because of the real world,"" Dr Toshner said. Safety has not been sacrificed. Instead the unparalleled scientific push to make the trials happen, the droves of people willing to take part, and of course the money blew many of the usual hold-ups aside.  That does not mean problems will not appear in the future - medical research cannot make those guarantees. Usually, side-effects of vaccines appear either at the time they are given or a few months afterwards. It is possible that rarer problems could emerge when millions of people are immunised, but this is true of every vaccine that has ever been developed.  Plans for giving regulatory approval and manufacturing the vaccine have also been dramatically speeded up.  The UK already has four million doses of the vaccine ready to deploy. The Oxford team partnered with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, and the manufacture of the vaccine started long before the results came in. At the time it was a gamble, but it has paid off big time.  Regulators, who would normally wait until after the trials were concluded, have also been involved early. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK has been conducting ""rolling reviews"" of the safety, manufacturing standards and effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine. It means a decision on whether the vaccine can be used will come early.  The Oxford vaccine has - like those of Pfizer and Moderna - arrived in record time to a world in desperate need.

What are the Covid rules at Christmas?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-55056375,Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? - BBC News,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News At Christmas, coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends. Across the UK, people will be able to form ""bubbles"" of three households over a five-day period.  Between 23 and 27 December, the three households will be allowed to form a temporary ""Christmas bubble"". They can mix indoors and stay overnight. Northern Ireland has been granted a longer window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:  The bubbles will be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else. There will be no limit to the number of people in a household joining a bubble. However, the rules about what counts as a household will depend on where you are. In England if you have formed a support bubble with another household, that counts as one household, so you can join with two other households in a Christmas bubble. People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate. Travel restrictions will be lifted to allow people to visit their families anywhere in the UK.  But the government has warned that there will not be extra public transport laid on. It has urged people to plan their travel in advance. You will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues. You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying. Places you can meet include parks, beaches, open countryside, public gardens, allotments and playgrounds. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation of restrictions will not be extended to cover New Year's Eve. She said: ""I know New Year is special for people, perhaps slightly more so in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, but the virus is still there."" The virus will not call a truce because it is Christmas, and will be as contagious as at any other time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Even if it is within the rules, meeting friends and family over Christmas will be a ""personal judgement"", the government says. People should consider the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to use the Christmas rules responsibly and ""only if you think it is necessary"". Children of parents who live apart are allowed to be part of two separate Christmas bubbles. This means they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students may return to their parents in the early December ""travel window"" and be counted as part of their household straight away. But if parents have three or more grown-up children who are not at university, then they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents. Individual households can split for Christmas. So, if three people are sharing a home, they can all go and form separate Christmas bubbles with their families and come back to form a single household again afterwards.  In England, care home residents have been told not to take part in Christmas bubbles, while visits out of the home should only be considered by residents who are of ""working age"". This is because of the increased risk of the resident catching coronavirus, and spreading it to other vulnerable people when they return, the government says. People are asked to consider whether visiting at the care home would ""provide meaningful contact in a safer way"", while residents who do leave will be tested and asked to isolate when they return.

How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas,,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-55017034,Covid: How to keep the virus at bay this Christmas - BBC News,"By David ShukmanBBC science editor Christmas is coming but how can you celebrate it without giving the unwelcome gift of coronavirus? Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. Unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. So here are the key questions to ask about any festivities.  No-one will be popular for saying this, but the evidence is clear - the larger the group, the greater the risk.  If it was summer and we could meet outside, where the virus gets dispersed in fresh air, it would be less of a problem. But it's winter, so everyone's inside.  And the more people who are involved, the greater the likelihood that someone may be a carrier of the virus - maybe without realising.  A study by Sage, the government's science advisory panel, concludes that if you double the number of people getting together, you get a fourfold increase in the odds of infection.  It also matters how many different households are meeting - the fewer the safer - because the more different homes which are mixing, the greater the potential for the virus to spread.   Passing around dishes and bottles, encouraging everyone to tuck in, is one of the most natural of instincts at Christmas. But the coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts.  In the US, the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners is to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Amid the excitement of reunions, it's perfectly normal for voices to be raised.  Add a little alcohol, and maybe have a TV or music on as well, and things get even noisier. But if someone is infected, the louder they speak, the more virus they release.  A lot of research shows that when voices are projected, people emit more tiny droplets of the kind that can carry the coronavirus. That's why for Thanksgiving gatherings, the US government advises: ""Encourage guests to avoid singing or shouting, especially indoors.  ""Keep music levels down so people don't have to shout or speak loudly to be heard."" Maybe the safest option is to hum Silent Night. Popping in for a quick visit is safer than lingering over dinner for several hours.  Researchers say an event's duration has a big impact on the infection risk. In March, more than 50 members of a choir in the US were confirmed or suspected of being infected, after a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal session.  Scientists reckoned that if it had lasted less than an hour, the number of infections would have been reduced by more than half.    Prof Cath Noakes, one of the study's authors, says the problem is that tiny particles carrying the virus, known as aerosols, can accumulate in the air.   ""There is growing evidence that if you're in a poorly-ventilated space for a long period of time with people who are infected, you may breathe in those aerosols and that might be one of the routes of infection,"" she said. The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A Sage report says infection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And in this context, ""ventilation"" doesn't mean having fans blowing the air around, but a flow of air from outside. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. According to Prof Noakes, people must dream up creative new options for Christmas That could range from meeting virtually on Zoom, going for a walk, braving the weather for a picnic, or even delaying big gatherings until next summer.  If you are planning a meal indoors, she says, make sure you keep everyone as far apart as possible and be careful to keep everything clean. Also try to avoid having people from different households sitting opposite each other because speaking face-to-face is a route of transmission. Any social setting increases the risk of infection, says Prof Noakes, and we will have to compromise, reduce our contacts with people and do things in a different way. ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas,"" she says. ""It's just a virus and it thrives on human contact.""

Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for,,https://www.bbc.com//news/business-55043908,Rishi Sunak's Spending Review: Four things to look out for - BBC News,"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak begins setting out plans for what he hopes will be an economy beyond Covid-19.  This Spending Review - detailing the money government departments will get for things like the NHS, education, roads, and police - only covers the financial year 2021-22. It will also set out money for the devolved administrations Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In normal times, reviews cover three or four years. But such is the economic uncertainty that this look-ahead has been limited to the next 12 months.  Even so, Mr Sunak will point to the direction of travel for spending (and possibly tax rises) for future years. Few reviews can have been so anticipated. Here's what to watch out for. The economic shock has left the UK poorer. By the end of this year the economy is expected to be at least 10% smaller than pre-pandemic.  Alongside the Spending Review, Mr Sunak will disclose latest forecasts for the economy and public finances from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Earlier this year, the OBR forecast a 13% contraction. While it is not expected to be that bad, the shrinkage will still likely be in the double-digits, and with public borrowing topping £350bn - something not seen in peacetime.  A difficulty for the chancellor is that big tranches of public service spending have already been made. Despite that, some areas will reportedly get more: NHS England, schools and defence. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), some two-thirds of public service spending has been pre-determined.  The key question is whether the remaining third is enough to go round. The answer is almost certainly not. The IFS thinks ""unprotected"" services such as the courts, prisons or local government are vulnerable to cuts. The overseas aid budget is also in the line of fire. Saving, not spending, will dominate Wednesday's agenda. And one of the biggest savings could be a public sector pay freeze. It would be hugely controversial. Media leaks last week claimed Mr Sunak wants a freeze for everyone except frontline NHS staff.  That won't go down well with the police, teachers, civil servants or anyone who thinks they've done their bit to ensure the public sector keeps going in tough times. Even a return to a 1% cap is likely to be fiercely resisted. Some commentators think the media reports were Treasury kite-flying. Even so, in the summer, Mr Sunak suggested that as private sector pay had taken a huge hit, in the ""interest of fairness"" the public sector's 5.4 million workers should share some pain. Trouble is, relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay has fallen to its lowest level in decades, according to the IFS.  Only during the pandemic has public sector pay performed more strongly than in the private sector. Union leaders have already warned of industrial action to ensure members' pay does not fall further behind.  Many promises have been thrown off-course because of the pandemic, and the government will be keen to get its north-south levelling up agenda back on track as soon as possible. Infrastructure spending is key to this.  The north has long complained that the Treasury methodology used to calculate the cost-benefit of spending money on big projects is inherently biased towards London and the rest of the south east. So, expect some changes to these calculations. And watch out for whether any spending promises are new money, or simply projects brought forward. To underline his commitment to spend on big long-term projects, there is talk that Mr Sunak could publish details of a National Infrastructure Strategy and a Research and Development Strategy.   And in a symbolic move that levelling up is more than a question of infrastructure, the Financial Times has reported that the chancellor could also announce that parts of government could relocate from the capital - with the Treasury leading the way. While Wednesday will be about spending and borrowing, at some point the chancellor will have to decide how it will be paid for. He will start to address this in next March's Budget, although most economic commentators feel the economy will still be too fragile for major tax rises. It is possible that, with the success of a Covid vaccine, the economy could bounce back, limiting the need for big rises. However, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC that four or five years down the road he still expects the economy to be about 4%-5% smaller than before the pandemic. Rein in spending and raise taxes too early, and recovery will be choked off. Leave it too late, and the public finances will spin out of control.  ""It's a fine judgement,"" said Mr Johnson. Both the chancellor and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have, however, said they don't want a return to austerity.  There have been reports the Treasury could raise money from changes to Capital Gains Tax, pensions relief or self-employment taxes. But this is tinkering.  Mr Johnson believes £40bn of tax rises are necessary over the short-term, and that sort of money cannot be raised without touching the Big Three: income tax, VAT or national insurance. These bring in almost two-thirds of government revenue. Spending Review: What is it and how does it affect me?

What will England's new lockdown rules be?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-52530518,"Covid: The new lockdown rules for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - BBC News","Plans to allow a temporary easing of Covid restrictions at Christmas have been announced.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also set out plans for the end of lockdown in England, and a return to a tougher three-tier system of restrictions. Between 23 and 27 December, up to three households will be allowed to form a temporary ""Christmas bubble"" and mix indoors. Northern Ireland has been granted a longer window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:  People are not allowed meet their Christmas bubble in hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or at entertainment venues. England's current lockdown will end just after midnight on Wednesday 2 December. After that, the following will apply to all areas: There will be different rules for pubs and spectator sports in the different tiers. For pubs: Spectator sports: The government will announce on 26 November which areas are in which tiers. This will be formally reviewed every 14 days.  More details of the plan are here. As before, you can only meet people from other households in a group of up to six. Rules about where you can do so apply. Only those in tier one areas will be able to meet people they don't live with indoors. People in tier two can't socialise with other households indoors. Those in tier three can't mix with other households indoors, or in private and pub gardens. There are exceptions for childcare and support bubbles. People are advised not to travel to and from tier three areas. Going to work or school Exercise Shops, pubs and other venues Worship, weddings and funerals Northern Ireland will go into a two-week circuit-break lockdown from 00:01 GMT on Friday 27 November. However, some other restrictions will be eased until then. Currently:  From Friday 27 November: Read Northern Ireland's official guidance. Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.  Eleven local authority areas in west and central Scotland have recently moved from level three to level four, affecting two million people. The areas are: City of Glasgow, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire, West Dunbartonshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the level four measures would be lifted on Friday 11 December.  East Lothian and Midlothian will move down from level three to level two on Tuesday 24 November. Schools stay open in all levels. People living in level three or level four must not travel outside their own council area, except for certain essential purposes. Those living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, apart from limited exceptional circumstances.  There must also be no non-essential travel between Scotland the rest of the UK. Lockdown restrictions in Wales were eased on 9 November.  The current rules say: People who you don't live with still cannot come into your home socially, unless you are in an extended household (bubble) with them. Tradespeople can enter your home to carry out work. Read Wales' official guidance. Do you meet other people for exercise? Have you been out walking during the November lockdown?

Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-55041371,Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? - BBC News,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Ten years' vaccine work achieved in about 10 months. Yet no corners cut in designing, testing and manufacturing. They are two statements that sound like a contradiction, and have led some to ask how we can be sure the Oxford vaccine - which has published its first results showing it is highly effective at stopping Covid-19 - is safe when it has been made so fast.  So, this is the real story of how the Oxford vaccine happened so quickly.  It is one that relies on good fortune as well as scientific brilliance; has origins in both a deadly Ebola outbreak and a chimpanzee's runny nose; and sees the researchers go from having no money in the bank to chartering private planes.  The biggest misconception is the work on the vaccine started when the pandemic began.  The world's biggest Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016 was a catastrophe. The response was too slow and 11,000 people died.  ""The world should have done better,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, the architect of the Oxford vaccine, told me.   In the recriminations that followed, a plan emerged for how to tackle the next big one. At the end of a list of known threats was ""Disease X"" - the sinister name of a new, unknown infection that would take the world by surprise.  The Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford - named after the scientist that performed the first vaccination in 1796, and now home to some of the world's leading experts - designed a strategy for defeating an unknown enemy.  ""We were planning how can we go really quickly to have a vaccine in someone in the shortest possible time,"" Prof Gilbert said.  ""We hadn't got the plan finished, but we did do pretty well."" The central piece of their plan was a revolutionary style of vaccine known as ""plug and play"". It has two highly desirable traits for facing the unknown - it is both fast and flexible.  Conventional vaccines - including the whole of the childhood immunisation programme - use a killed or weakened form of the original infection, or inject fragments of it into the body. But these are slow to develop.   Instead the Oxford researchers constructed ChAdOx1 - or Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford One. Scientists took a common cold virus that infected chimpanzees and engineered it to become the building block of a vaccine against almost anything.  Before Covid, 330 people had been given ChAdOx1 based-vaccines for diseases ranging from flu to Zika virus, and prostate cancer to the tropical disease chikungunya. The virus from chimps is genetically modified so it cannot cause an infection in people. It can then be modified again to contain the genetic blueprints for whatever you want to train the immune system to attack. This target is known is an antigen.  ChAdOx1 is in essence a sophisticated, microscopic postman. All the scientists have to do is change the package. ""We drop it in and off we go,"" said Prof Gilbert. While much of the world was having a lie-in after New Year's Eve, Prof Gilbert noticed concerning reports of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan, China. Within two weeks scientists had identified the virus responsible and began to suspect it was able to spread between people.  ""We'd been planning for disease X, we'd been waiting for disease X, and I thought this could be it,"" Prof Gilbert said. At this point, the team did not know how important their work would become. It started out as a test of how fast they could go and as a demonstration of the ChAdOx1 technology. Prof Gilbert said: ""I thought it might only have been a project, we'd make the vaccine and the virus would fizzle out. But it didn't."" It sounds strange to say it, almost perverse, but it was lucky that the pandemic was caused by a coronavirus.  This family of viruses had tried to jump from animals to people twice before in the past 20 years - Sars coronavirus in 2002 and Mers coronavirus in 2012. It meant scientists knew the virus's biology, how it behaved and its Achilles heel - the ""spike protein"". ""We had a huge head start,"" Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford team said. The spike protein is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. If a vaccine could train the immune system to attack the spike, then the team knew they were odds-on to succeed. And they had already developed a ChAdOx1 vaccine for Mers, which could train the immune system to spot the spike. The Oxford team were not starting from scratch.   ""If this had been a completely unknown virus, then we'd have been in a very different position,"" Prof Pollard added.  It was also lucky that coronaviruses cause short-term infections. It means the body is capable of beating the virus and a vaccine just needs to tap into that natural process.  If it had been a long-term or chronic infection that the body cannot beat - like HIV - then it's unlikely a vaccine could work.  On 11 January, Chinese scientists published and shared with the world the full genetic code of the coronavirus. The team now had everything they needed to make a Covid-19 vaccine.  All they had to do was slip the genetic instructions for the spike protein into ChAdOx1 and they were good to go. Making a vaccine is very expensive.  ""The first bit was quite painful. There was a period when we didn't have any money in the bank,"" said Prof Pollard.  They had some funding from the university, but they had a crucial advantage over other groups around the world.  On the site of Churchill hospital in Oxford is the group's own vaccine manufacturing plant.  ""We could say stop everything else and make this vaccine,"" said Prof Pollard. It was enough to get going, but not to make the thousands of doses needed for larger trials.  ""Getting money was my main activity until April, just trying to persuade people to fund it now,"" said Prof Gilbert.  But as the pandemic tightened its grip on the world and country after country descended into lockdown, the money started to flow. Production of the vaccine moved to a facility in Italy and the money helped solve problems that would have otherwise held up the trials, including the logistical nightmare of lockdown Europe. ""At one point we had to charter a plane, the vaccine was in Italy and we had clinics here the next morning,"" said Prof Gilbert.  Quality control is never the sexiest part of a project, but researchers cannot start giving an experimental vaccine to people until they are sure it has been made to a high enough standard.  At every stage of the manufacturing process, they needed to ensure the vaccine was not being contaminated with viruses or bacteria. In the past this had been a lengthy process.  ""If we had not been thinking about how to shorten the time, we might have had a vaccine in March but not started trials until June.""  Instead, once animal trials had shown the vaccine was safe, the researchers were able to begin human trials of the vaccine on 23 April.  Since then the Oxford vaccine has been through every stage of trials that would normally take place for a vaccine.  There is a pattern to clinical trials: The Oxford vaccine has been through each of those stages, including 30,000 volunteers in the phase three trial, and the team has as much data as any other vaccine trial. What hasn't happened is years of hanging around in between each phase.  Dr Mark Toshner, who has been involved in the trials at sites in Cambridge, said the idea that it took 10 years to trial a vaccine was misleading. He told the BBC: ""Most of the time, it's a lot of nothing.""  He describes it as a process of writing grant applications, having them rejected, writing them again, getting approval to do the trial, negotiating with manufacturers, and trying to recruit enough people to take part. It can take years to get from one phase to the next.  ""The process is long, not because it needs to be and not because it's safe, but because of the real world,"" Dr Toshner said. Safety has not been sacrificed. Instead the unparalleled scientific push to make the trials happen, the droves of people willing to take part, and of course the money blew many of the usual hold-ups aside.  That does not mean problems will not appear in the future - medical research cannot make those guarantees. Usually, side-effects of vaccines appear either at the time they are given or a few months afterwards. It is possible that rarer problems could emerge when millions of people are immunised, but this is true of every vaccine that has ever been developed.  Plans for giving regulatory approval and manufacturing the vaccine have also been dramatically speeded up.  The UK already has four million doses of the vaccine ready to deploy. The Oxford team partnered with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, and the manufacture of the vaccine started long before the results came in. At the time it was a gamble, but it has paid off big time.  Regulators, who would normally wait until after the trials were concluded, have also been involved early. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK has been conducting ""rolling reviews"" of the safety, manufacturing standards and effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine. It means a decision on whether the vaccine can be used will come early.  The Oxford vaccine has - like those of Pfizer and Moderna - arrived in record time to a world in desperate need.

Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-55056016,Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? - BBC News,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online There could soon be several effective vaccines available to fight Covid-19. But while many people want an injection as soon as possible, others are worried about putting something unknown into their bodies.  This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment.  Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies.  The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective too.  That involves tests on large numbers of volunteers.  Half are given the vaccine and the other half a dummy or placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which until after the results have been analysed, to avoid bias. All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently.  The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps.  The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine trial was voluntarily put on hold at one stage to investigate why one participant - out of many thousands - had died. It restarted once it was clear it was not related to the vaccine. Approval will only be given for a vaccine if the government regulator (the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency or MHRA) is happy that it's both safe and effective.  After approval, checks continue to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks.  If anyone suspects they are suffering a side effect from a vaccination, they can report it to the MHRA. There are lots of different Covid vaccines in development. Some contain the pandemic virus itself in a weakened form.  The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like Sars-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines use bits of genetic code to cause an immune response, and are called mRNA vaccines.  These do not alter human cells. They only present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. Some Covid jabs contain proteins from coronavirus.  Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. There is no evidence that any of these ingredients cause harm when used in such small amounts. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do suffer mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.  This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These may not be based on scientific evidence. If a coronavirus vaccine is approved, it is likely that people will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past.  That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine.  And some vaccines are grown on hen's eggs, or cells from chick embryos.  There are hundreds of Covid vaccines in development. We don't have details on every ingredient yet, but many of the Covid vaccines are expected to be vegetarian or vegan friendly. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.  Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives. The first doses that become available will probably be offered to people with the highest need - such as the elderly - who could become severely ill. It is not yet clear how much protection vaccines might give in terms of stopping people from spreading Covid.  If they can do this well, vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease.

Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/uk-55043551,Prof Sarah Gilbert: The woman who designed the Oxford vaccine - BBC News,"If Prof Sarah Gilbert had gone with her instincts, the latest coronavirus vaccine to show highly promising results might never have been. Years ago, studying for her PhD, she considered packing in science altogether. As a young student in biological sciences at the University of East Anglia, she was energised by the diversity of thought and experience in the department. But when she progressed to her doctorate, at the University of Hull, she found the tunnel-like focus was not to her liking. ""There are some scientists who will happily work more or less on their own on one subject for a very long time… That's not the way I like to work. I like to try to take into account ideas from lots of different areas,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific, earlier this year.  ""I did consider leaving science at that point and doing something different."" Eventually though she decided to have ""one more go at a scientific career… I needed the income"". It was a decision that led us to the announcement on Tuesday morning that, according to the results of late stage trials, the University of Oxford's coronavirus vaccine is highly effective at stopping people developing Covid-19 symptoms. Interim data suggests it affords 70% protection, but researchers say the figure may be as high as 90% by tweaking the dose. Born in Kettering, Northamptonshire in April 1962, Sarah Gilbert's father worked in the shoe business while her mother was an English teacher and member of the local amateur operatic society. Speaking to Radio 4's Profile, one school friend recalled Sarah's silent steeliness - a trait which perhaps explains her decision, years later, to stick with her PhD despite her doubts. Having completed her doctorate, she got a job with a brewing research centre, looking at how to manipulate brewing yeast, before moving on to work in human health. She had never meant to be a vaccine specialist. Yet by the mid-1990s, she was in an academic job at the University of Oxford, looking at the genetics of malaria. And that led to work on malaria vaccines. Her life became a little more complicated when she gave birth to triplets. Raising them is an experience which one friend suggested explains her ""no nonsense approach"". Her son Freddie describes his mother as always being supportive and having the children's best interests at heart. All three children chose to follow their own path, he says - although all ended up choosing to study biochemistry at university. Meanwhile, at Oxford, Dr Gilbert rose through the ranks, becoming a professor at the university's prestigious Jenner Institute. She set up her own research group in a bid to create a universal flu vaccine, meaning a vaccine which would be effective against all the different strains.  In 2014, she led the first trial of an Ebola vaccine. And when the Mers - Middle East respiratory syndrome - virus struck, she travelled to Saudi Arabia to try to develop a vaccine for this form of coronavirus. The second trial of that vaccine was just beginning when, in early 2020, Covid-19 emerged in China. Prof Gilbert quickly realised she might be able to use the same approach. ""We were quick,"" says her colleague at Oxford, Prof Teresa Lambe. As Chinese scientists published the genetic structure of the new virus ""over the weekend, the vaccine was pretty much designed. We went pretty fast with it."" Her urgency, in the face of Covid's death march around the world, might explain some of her more unorthodox working practices.  Emails come in as early as 4am, says Prof Lambe, who, explains that Prof Gilbert tends to work from very early in the morning until the late evening. It took a few weeks to create a vaccine that worked against Covid in the lab. Then the first batch went into manufacture by early April, as the rigorous testing regime expanded. Prof Gilbert described the process as a series of small steps - rather than there being a big breakthrough moment. ""From the beginning, we're seeing it as a race against the virus, not a race against other vaccine developers,"" she said earlier this year. ""We're a university and we're not in this to make money."" School, university friends and colleagues describe a conscientious, quiet and determined person and someone with ""true grit"". ""Sometimes I think she can be quite shy and reserved to people,"" one of her PhD students, told Profile. ""Some colleagues I had at the Jenner Institute always were a little bit intimidated by Sarah. But when you get to know her and you spend time with her, that's not the case at all."" The gaze of the world is now on Prof Gilbert and the world's handful of other Covid vaccine architects, as they race against the clock. ""She's gonna hate it, absolutely hate it,"" says her friend, biochemist Dr Anne Moore. ""I mean, Sarah is the person in the room who does not want to be in the limelight.""

"UK coronavirus cases up by 18,213 on Wednesday",,https://www.bbc.com//news/uk-51768274,Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? - BBC News,"There have been more than 1.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 55,000 people have died, government figures show.  However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.

After the first peak in April, cases started rising in the UK again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that recent figures suggest ""the second peak is flattening"". On Wednesday, the government announced a further 18,213 confirmed cases.  It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is tracking Covid-19 in the community, also suggest that infections have levelled off in recent weeks. Approximately one in 80 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 14 November, according to the ONS. That's about 665,000 people and slightly up on the previous week.  In Wales, about one in 165 (18,400 people) had the virus during the same time period, while in Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 135 people (about 13,600 people).  In Scotland, the figure was one in 155 having the virus (about 34,000 people). The South East, London and the East of England are the only areas to have seen cases rise in recent weeks.  The average number of daily deaths has been rising since September. On Wednesday, the government announced a further 696 deaths.  Of these, 604 deaths were in England, 44 in Scotland, 41 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland.  Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included. England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been nearly 50,000.   Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.  The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three appears to be improving.  Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. 
            Sorry, your browser cannot display this map
         Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.  In England, a tougher three-tiered system of local restrictions which will come into force when the national lockdown ends on 2 December.  In Northern Ireland, a two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown will begin on 27 November.  In Wales, a two-week ""firebreak"" lockdown, which began in the last week of October, has now ended but some restrictions are still in place.  Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country. UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.  When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways. Government figures count people who tested positive for coronavirus and died within 28 days. But there are two other measures.  The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 66,000 deaths by 13 November. The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 73,000 by 13 November. The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the second week of November, which show there were 13,972 deaths registered in the UK. Some 2,838 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - up from 2,225 the week before.  Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.  The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.  If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.  The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 1 to 1.1. The estimate for England is 1 to 1.1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.9 to 1.2 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1. The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.

Inside test-and-trace - what went wrong?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-55008133,Coronavirus: Inside test-and-trace - how the 'world beater' went wrong - BBC News,"By Nick Triggle, Rachel Schraer and Phil KempBBC News Just half of close contacts given to England's NHS Test and Trace are being reached in some areas, a BBC investigation has found. Six months after Boris Johnson promised a ""world beating"" system, it can be shown the network is failing in areas with some of the worst infection rates. The research also found no-one from NHS labs was at a key government meeting with private firms about testing. But the government said the system was ""undoubtedly"" curbing Covid spreading. It added that NHS Test and Trace was dealing with rising numbers of cases and was working hard to ""refine and improve"" the way it worked. The companies and their leaders involved with testing had ""hundreds of years"" of experience in the field, it said. As ministers struggle to get test-and-trace on track, BBC News spoke to key government figures, scientists and health officials who were involved from the very start to establish what went wrong - and, crucially, whether the system can be fixed to hold the virus in check until vaccines come to the rescue. The investigation found a system performing worst in the areas where it is needed the most and still struggling with the legacy of decisions that were made at the outset.  Further revelations include the fact that a move to more local contact tracing by councils was being undermined by IT problems, leading to a reliance on spreadsheets and delays getting contact details. The name NHS Test and Trace sounds like it is one whole service that is part of the NHS. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a complex web of different programmes, led by the civil service, that have been bolted together rapidly. Private firms play a key role in terms of both testing and tracing, which has meant some of the local expertise available in the NHS, universities and councils has been bypassed. The seeds for this were sown back on 17 March before the first lockdown was announced when a group of companies met with government to discuss testing. That meeting included now-key players Randox and ThermoFisher, two health-technology firms. But no representatives speaking for the existing NHS labs sector were involved, says Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science. ""There wasn't any consultation with the service itself."" Very quickly the direction of travel became clear - the government turned to its commercial partners to set up large, centralised labs that sat outside any existing healthcare or research structures. There is now a network of six large mega-labs - known as Lighthouse labs - that process the bulk of the tests across the UK. Testing sites, where the swabs are taken, were set up by management consultants Deloitte. A similar decision was made with contact tracing. Sitel runs the contact centre and a national army of 18,000 contact tracers were taken, mostly employed by outsourcing company Serco. The team does though include around 3000 clinicians, some of whom have come from the NHS. This element just covers England. The rest of the UK has its own arrangements. The government said while the contracts were awarded under ""extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events"" they were still done in accordance with strict conditions. But those close to the decision-making at the time have concerns. ""These contracts were signed and sealed in record time - there weren't even penalty clauses inserted for performance in many,"" says one source involved. ""The government was in a panic - we were in the middle of lockdown and they were under pressure from all angles. It is not the environment in which the best decisions are made.""  And so it proved.  The government has now got a large testing capacity - it can process more than 500,000 virus tests a day. At the start, the UK could only do 2,000. But the system has struggled to shorten the time it takes from someone being swabbed to getting a result.  Sir Paul Nurse at the Francis Crick Institute, which set up its own local Covid testing programme, said government always talked about capacity: ""basically how many machines they have working in the lab"" but never actually did the number of  tests they claimed they could, ""because of the problem with logistics"".   ""If we'd kept it local we would have been able to turn those tests around much quicker,"" says Mr Wilson, referring to the existing network of hospital, university and Public Health England labs. ""We already had the logistics in place.""  Instead, an entirely new system had to be set up to get the samples into the Lighthouse labs, with swabs travelling long distances - sometimes by plane from Edinburgh to Belfast - slowing down the process to this day. A test's value diminishes the longer it takes to give a result. Dr Rachael Liebmann, vice-chair at the Royal College of Pathologists, who works in both private and NHS labs, says: ""The default was to go outside the NHS for something new and shiny. But there was not enough input from people who understood testing.""  According to Allan Wilson, the government was ""speaking directly to the commercial companies and saying - what can you do for us?"" There was no voice of challenge, ""saying 'that won't work'"". Companies were selling testing machines to NHS-run labs which did testing for hospitals. This was despite the fact the kits and chemicals needed for those machines were in short supply and being snapped up by the mostly privately-run Lighthouse labs.  ""There are labs that bought... equipment and still are not able to run them at capacity due to a lack of reagents [chemicals needed for testing],"" Dr Liebmann says.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the system was run in partnership with the NHS and the joint effort was ""crucial to provide the huge capacity needed to support the national effort against the coronavirus pandemic"". The government's obsession with hitting testing targets has also been heavily criticised. First 10,000 tests a day by the end of March, then 100,000 a day by the end of April, before a target for capacity of 500,000 a day by the end of October. But there was less focus about who should get those tests and why.  Despite regular advice to do so, people working in hospitals were not screened for coronavirus unless they had symptoms. This has only just started happening, despite evidence showing significant transmission in hospitals. But there were labs that did set up regular screening for healthcare staff of their own accord - despite being ""effectively discouraged"" to do so, according to one source.  The University of Cambridge was one example, its research lab partnering with nearby Addenbrooke's to offer screening to its hospital staff at the peak of the UK epidemic's first wave. By the end of June it had screened more than 10,000 people working in the hospital, to detect asymptomatic carriers, says Dr Stephen Baker, who was involved in creating the programme. ""It had a really big impact on keeping the hospital going,"" and, he believes, helped give NHS staff some sense of safety and morale. Many of the issues with testing played out behind the scenes. But they came under acute public scrutiny in September when tests became near-impossible to access - just at the moment the second wave was taking off.  Part of this was driven by individuals applying for tests on return from holidays, and children going back to school. But there were also issues of capacity in the labs themselves. One volunteer in a Lighthouse lab, a virologist who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC supply chain issues slowed progress: ""We would never know how many samples were going to come in. We had a forecast each day but they were never right."" This meant sometimes having enough staff to process 10,000 samples and only receiving 2,000, leaving people sitting around, and on other occasions receiving many more than expected and struggling to deal with them. While scientists were involved in setting up the labs, they weren't necessarily people ""who had any idea how to deal with viruses"", meaning ""procedures were constantly tweaked"", according to the volunteer, and there were issues with recruitment and training which again slowed things down.  Testing is one part of the equation for containing coronavirus. Every bit as important is the ability to trace close contacts of those infected, ensuring they isolate at home. For the tracing service, which went live at the end of May, just a week after the prime minister's world beating promise, problems have played out in different ways. About 18,000 contact tracers were hired - only about 3,000 of them came from a clinical background. That in itself was not necessarily an issue. Those involved in the service say the people who get the best results are the good communicators. The problem is that so often the centralised call centre-based approach did not let them communicate. Contact tracers were told to follow heavily scripted cues.  There was no room for discretion. It has led to the situation whereby call handlers have to try to make individual calls to every member of a household and go through the same forms. This is part of the reason some families have found themselves receiving lots of calls.  One test-and-trace manager told the BBC it has undermined the system throughout. ""It causes a massive amount of stress. A lot of contact workers are upset because they get a lot of abuse about it."" The government said after feedback it was in the process of changing the system so families do not get multiple calls if the person who is infected confirms they have informed the rest of the household of the situation and the need to isolate. Overall, performance has fallen short of what was hoped for. To be effective, government advisers say 80% of people who test positive should be reached and details of their close contacts - chiefly family, friends and work colleagues - obtained. Then 80% of those contacts ought to be reached and asked to isolate. In some areas just half of close contacts are being reached and asked to isolate. A number are in the areas with the highest rates, such as Bradford, Manchester, Blackburn and Nottingham. The targets are rather broad brush. For one thing they ignore the fact that the testing system is routinely failing to identify about half of cases. The blame for this cannot be laid solely on the government - with so many infected people not showing symptoms, the system is up against it from the start. But with the targets missed almost every week, it quickly became clear there was too much focus on the national system and not enough on local. Much of the criticism has been aimed at Baroness Dido Harding, who was recruited to head up NHS Test and Trace. However, this was only once the contracts had been signed and the model of working established. Working with what she has, she is adamant her team have performed well, regularly pointing out that despite the problems the service is still doing better than those in many other countries. She says a system as ""complex as Tesco"" with its network of stores, distribution centres and supply chains has been built in a matter of months. ""It will keep improving,"" she says. ""But you can't expect test-and-trace on its own to keep on top of the virus - it is just one part of a wider approach."" Comparing performance globally is difficult. Many do not publish the detailed information that England's service does. Even the data provided in the rest of UK is more limited by comparison - although it suggests those systems have struggled too. But some countries have fared better - Germany and South Korea, for example. The Health Foundation says the key is those countries' greater emphasis on local teams. The need for greater local involvement was actually recognised by the government back in the summer. On 10 August, ministers announced they were changing tack and the national contact tracing team would be cut by 6,000.  Staff were to be made available to councils to allow them to set up local teams which could take on responsibility for tracing cases after the first 24 hours. It followed the success seen in a small handful of areas that had decided to set up their own local contact tracing teams. The announcement by government was widely welcomed by directors of public health, but then nothing happened. It was not until late October that ministers came up with an extra £1bn for the winter. This has been a source of huge frustration. Councils had been calling for more involvement from the start. And as local schemes have got going - over a half have services up-and-running now - they have faced difficulties because of the centralised nature of the system. Among the problems reported are: ""It's a complete nightmare,"" says one public health consultant who has set up a service. ""We've been given a hospital pass. They never thought about using the local teams so the infrastructure isn't there."" While £10bn was set aside for test-and-trace to help them find individuals, it seems very little thought was given to how people should be supported to isolate. The number isolating both after a positive test or because they are a close contact, is not routinely measured. Some research has suggested it may be as low as one in five, but NHS Test and Trace has put the figure at close to half. Either way, it is a glaring issue. A few have argued the isolation period is too long. Some other countries only require seven days' isolation for close contacts, says Prof Tim Spector, who runs the popular C-19 symptom tracker app. ""More reality and pragmatism is now needed to keep people on-side,"" he says.  On top of that, there are questions about financial support for people who can't work while isolating at home. Until late September there was none beyond statutory sick pay. Now there is a one-off £500 payment for people on benefits. People who are asked to isolate via the app are not even entitled to this. Contact tracers the BBC spoke to say this is causing problems. ""When we do get through, people are often uncooperative. They have lives to get on with and work they have to do to get paid."" Prof Robert West, from University College London's public health department, believes this is one of the most important issues with the whole system. ""We need to do much more to help - then we can create strong social norms that it would be unthinkable to violate."" The problem, though, he says, is we have missed the boat. With infections high, the window for getting this right has gone. ""If introducing lockdown late was our biggest mistake in the first wave, in the second it is the fact we wasted the time that lockdown bought us to get an effective test-and-trace system running.""

Is everything fine if the recession is over?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/business-52986863,Coronavirus: What is a recession and how could it affect me? - BBC News,"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News The recession is over. The UK saw the best economic growth on record. But times are still hard, and the economy is not actually doing that well.  How can all these things be true at the same time, and why does it matter? In normal times, a country's economy grows.  Its citizens, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes their value falls, and a recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. It's a sign the economy is doing badly. The first two quarters of 2020 saw GDP falling sharply, making it the worst recession on record, and the first in the UK since 2009. For most people, economic growth is good.  It usually means there are more jobs, and companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more.  A growing economy also gives the government more money in taxes. So it can cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. The third quarter of 2020 saw the UK economy growing again, meaning that technically the recession was over. July to September saw the fastest three-month growth on record - 15.5% - which would be extraordinary in normal times.  But what the figures capture is an economy shutting down and reopening again. Shops and restaurants closed in the spring during the nationwide shutdown, and reopened in the summer.  People started going out, taking holidays and getting back to some of their normal lives. They spent more money, bringing the amount of economic activity closer to where it was last year. However there is still a big gap between how the economy was doing last year, and where it stands today. Though the recession is over, the economy is 9.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic. That reflects the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs, and millions are still on furlough, with the government paying most of their wages. Many businesses still have far less trade than before the pandemic.  It takes a while for statisticians to calculate the size of the economy, so their figures always describe the recent past, not what's happening today. The latest figures run to the end of September, before wide-ranging new lockdowns were introduced around the UK.  However, the recovery's pace was already slowing down in September. When figures for the October to December quarter are published, they may well show GDP falling again as England's nationwide lockdown and measures in other nations hit the economy.  If the following quarter also sees a fall, then that would be a second recession, or what is sometimes called a ""double-dip"" recession, where two recessions happen close together.  However, Bank of England forecasts expect to see growth next year. And if an effective vaccine becomes widely available, that would strongly boost the recovery.  The UK has been doing worse than other major worldwide economies. The UK economy is 9.7% smaller than it was before the crisis began, but the US is only 3.5% smaller. France is 4.1% down, Germany is 4.2% down, and Spain is 9.1% down. The UK's poor performance compared with other countries is partly down to a longer lockdown, experts believe.  The world economy will shrink by 4.4% in total this year, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts. This is less bad than the Fund expected three months ago, as the recession was less severe than they expected.  Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to get promotions, or a pay rise. Graduates and school leavers could find a first job harder to get. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase.  For instance, many UK homeowners who kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. Mortgage interest payments for many fell considerably, leaving them with more spending money. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. In the UK, the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards.  GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period. Unemployment rose sharply, but began to fall back again two years later.  And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services. This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity. There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid.  The 2020 recession has caused the government to run an even bigger deficit, and national debt has also grown rapidly during the period. An effective vaccine would give the recovery the biggest possible boost.  In the meantime, the UK government and others around the world are borrowing huge sums to pay for schemes to protect jobs, support businesses and combat the virus.  The Bank of England is also supporting the economy by through quantitative easing, where it tries to encourage individuals and businesses to invest and spend more by buying government bonds.

How many people could become unemployed?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/business-52660591,Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? - BBC News,"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News Employers are cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs as Covid-19 continues to hit the economy. While many parts of the country went into lockdown to combat the spread of the virus, unemployment numbers have been rising sharply. How high could the unemployment rate go? The most widely used measure is the unemployment rate. It counts how many people are able to work and want a job, but can't find one.  The most recent unemployment rate - for July to September - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  That is an increase of 0.7% over the previous three months, and meant that 1.62 million people were unemployed. However, this number is always based on surveys taken in previous months and is not right up to date. Some of the data was gathered in July and August, when infection rates were falling, and large parts of the economy were reopening. So this figure is likely to carry on rising in coming months. Most economists expect unemployment to continue rising for the rest of the year. UK unemployment is likely to reach 2.6 million in the middle of 2021, according to the government's economic watchdog, or 7.5% of the working age population. It's currently about 1.6 million. This is echoed by the Bank of England, which forecasts that unemployment will most likely peak at about 7.7% in April to June of next year. There was a high degree of uncertainty around that forecast, with a small chance that it could rise as high as 10%. However, those forecasts don't take into account the government's decision to extend the furlough scheme to the end of March. The government has been trying to protect jobs through a number of measures. The largest is the furlough scheme, where it pays most of the wages for workers when their employers cannot. That has prevented many of those people becoming unemployed. However, the furlough scheme was being wound down in September and October, ahead of its planned closure on 31 October.  Many companies cut jobs in preparation for the end of the scheme, and July to September saw a record rise in the number of redundancies of 181,000.  The government has now announced an extension to the scheme for another five months, which it hopes will protect more jobs.  The easing of lockdown restrictions across the summer also boosted the numbers of people counted as unemployed.  People who weren't looking for a job during the first lockdown were considered ""economically inactive"", and weren't included in the figures. But as the rules changed, they began to look for work and were therefore classed as unemployed.  The figures for July to September saw a record number of people move from inactive to unemployed -  215,000.  One of the hardest-hit groups has been young people. The figures show that 174,000 fewer 16- to 24-year-olds were employed in July to September, compared to the previous three months.   The ONS says that this is because young people are more likely to be working in areas such as hotels, restaurants and tourism. Jobs like these have been particularly hard-hit by lockdown, and quarantine restrictions have reduced the number of tourists. The latest official statistics capture the state of the country before a lockdown across all of England was announced, and the extension of the furlough scheme. They do show a picture of many things improving, although that may not last.  The total number of hours people worked in July to September increased as parts of the economy reopened and people returned to work.  The average amount people earn had been falling sharply during the crisis, but it rose 1.9% in the latest figures (excluding bonuses). The number of job vacancies available also continued to increase, but there are still 35% less than a year ago. The start of the pandemic saw a big increase in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, which was much bigger than the rise in the number of people counted as unemployed.  In October 2020 the number of people claiming either Jobseeker's Allowance or universal credit because they were ""searching for work"" was 2.6 million, 1.4 million higher than March, before the pandemic had begun to take effect.  However, some of these people are working, but with low earnings either because they are on low wages or short hours.  The ONS says it cannot tell how many of those people are out of work, or whether they are now able to get universal credit because the rules for claiming it have changed.

Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-52135342,Covid: Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? - BBC News,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News Workers for firms hit by lockdowns or Covid restrictions can now be furloughed until the end of March. Under the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, employees placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month.  The scheme pays some of the wages of people who can't do their jobs because their workplace is closed, or there is no longer enough work for them. They may also be unable to work because someone in their household has to shield, or they have caring responsibilities due to coronavirus, such as looking after children. You can be furloughed whether you are on a full-time, part-time, agency, flexible or zero-hour contract.  You must have been on the payroll by 30 October 2020. It is not necessary to have been furloughed before and you keep all your working rights, including annual and parental leave. There is also some help for people who recently lost their jobs but were not placed on furlough. If you were employed and on the payroll on 23 September, but were then made redundant or stopped working, you can be re-employed and claimed for by your former employer. While you are on furlough you can take on other jobs, as long as it doesn't break the rules of your contract. You can also take part in training, or volunteer for an unconnected organisation. Since July, employers have been able to bring back employees part-time, and furlough them for the rest. This will continue, and employers will have to pay employee's wages for the hours they work as normal. Furlough was due to be replaced by the Job Support Scheme on 1 November. But as month-long restrictions began in England, including the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops, the government said furlough would continue. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says it will run until the end of March, although the government will decide in January whether employers should start paying into the scheme. While employees won't notice any difference in their pay packet, the scheme has become more generous for employers, who will pay less towards it.  In recent months, firms have had to top up furloughed wages by 20%, with the government paying 60%. Now, the state will put in the full 80%, with the employer only covering pension and National Insurance contributions. While the government updates the system, employers will submit their wage claim to the government, and be refunded afterwards. After that, they will be paid upfront to cover the cost.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed the scheme will still apply throughout the UK, saying the country had ""a Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom"". About 10 million jobs have already been claimed for, with an estimated two million people still on furlough at the end of October.

‘There's more chocolate at home than I could imagine',,https://www.bbc.com//news/business-54849444,CEO Secrets: The dads getting entrepreneurial in lockdown - BBC News,"By Dougal ShawBusiness reporter, BBC News As part of our CEO Secrets series, which invites business leaders to share their advice, we are focusing on start-ups that have launched during lockdown. Each week we will look at a different type of entrepreneur. This week, we hear from fathers balancing a new business with childcare. A consignment of 300kg of chocolate arrives at the house of Keith Tiplady, 35, in Leicester. He moves bags containing thousands of pure chocolate pellets to a dedicated room in his house, where he also stores 1.5km of ribbon. This is the ""new normal"" for Keith, who is now a chocolatier. Until Covid-19 struck, he was a project manager with Triumph Motorcycles. But in April he was furloughed and later he was made redundant.  In the short term he had his wife's income to rely on. She works full-time for the NHS. But the cost of childcare for their three-year-old twins was more than their mortgage, so something had to change. Keith decided to look after the twins himself, while also setting up a business from home.  His entrepreneurial wife ran a bakery business in the evenings from their kitchen. Keith had always been fascinated by her chocolate-tempering machine, which she used to make decorative curls for cakes. The machine melts chocolate pellets (known as callets) at controlled temperatures, turning them to liquid. Keith experimented with things his wife hadn't tried, like chocolate moulds. Before he knew it he was creating ganache and caramel-filled, Belgian chocolates. And so his start-up, Indulgent Chocolates, was born.  During the spring lockdown, he set up ""walking markets"" for local entrepreneurs like himself, where people sell from stalls in their driveway, garden or garage. He also found success selling the chocolates online. People were buying them as gifts to be posted out to teachers, or for birthdays in lockdown. Keith of course had to combine chocolate making with childcare. ""In between making chocolates I'm reading stories with them and playing games, then I wash my hands and get back to work,"" he says. ""In a way I'm lucky they are twins, they play really well with each other."" The business is generating more money now as corporate clients put in orders - hence the 300kg consignment of chocolate. ""If this business scales up it will allow me to live a normal life again,"" he says, ""and I won't have to worry about affording Christmas presents."" However, he also now faces a dilemma. He's had interest from employers that could lead to a new role similar to his old job. His wife remains supportive, though she would prefer him to find secure paid employment again. Then again, she also enjoys testing his latest creations in the kitchen. Kavin Wadhar, 36, from London, quit his corporate job with a FTSE 100 company in February. The father-of-two says he had ""an entrepreneurial itch to scratch"". He comes from a family of teachers and he'd been dreaming of an educational app after reading a fact that shocked him. ""Children only spend 20% of their waking hours in school, so parents actually have a lot of power to shape, mould and educate their child, coaching moments if you like,"" says Kavin. His product is called KidCoachApp. It guides parents through five-minute conversations, designed to expand their children's minds, and promote soft skills and emotional wellbeing. There are questions like: How would you explain computers to Julius Caesar? What would the world be like today if dinosaurs were still alive? The app was informed partly by his experience with his own family. He has children aged four and two, as well as many nephews and nieces.  He felt he was having too many ""snatched conversations that felt transactional"", along the lines of, ""What did you have for lunch today? Who did you play with at school?"" Although Kavin didn't intend to launch his app in a pandemic, he thinks the timing is actually good for him. ""I see this as a tailwind, not a headwind, because in lockdown parents are discovering life in a lower gear and they appreciate family time more."" He even thinks that having his children at home while developing the business has been beneficial, bringing mental health benefits. ""Being an entrepreneur is hard and there is something incredibly stress relieving about being able to nip down and play with the kids for five minutes in the kitchen. It can make you more focused and productive knowing you have the lovely reward of bathtime."" His advice to other dads is not to be intimidated by the typical image of an entrepreneur as a bold 20-something with nothing to lose. ""As an older person with a young family you have lots of advantages. You have business and life experience and a network to call upon - take confidence in this."" Thomas Parkes, 51, from Bristol, had a different child-related issue to contend with during lockdown - a teenage son at a loose end, whom he feared was losing his way in life.  Before Covid-19 struck, Thomas ran a successful company called 4x4 Adventure Tours. He took clients on ""Top Gear-style"" adventures in the UK and abroad, tackling challenging off-road routes. These trips were cancelled during lockdown. He was able to access a few support grants, but he knew his main business was in peril. However, he also spotted a gap in the market. He sensed that ""staycations"" were becoming more popular due to the same travel restrictions that were ruining his business. He also saw that there was an increased demand for campervans and tents. From his adventure holidays, he knew all about a special kind of tent that sits on top of your vehicle. ""It's popular on safaris,"" explains Thomas, ""so you don't get eaten by lions at night."" Thomas set up a side business called ADV Roof Tents to start selling these products, which retail from £1,200, sourcing bespoke versions from China. At the same time he realised his son Oliver was struggling. A low point was when he turned 18 in April and couldn't go to the pub with his mates to celebrate. He also had to deal with his A-Level exams being cancelled. Although he got good grades, he decided not to apply to university.  However, he struggled to find any work, so reluctantly he agreed to help out his dad selling tents. Oliver's input would prove crucial to the new enterprise's success, because he brought skills his dad didn't have. He set up a website, directed photoshoots and films for Instagram and Facebook, as well as doing some old-fashioned heavy lifting of crates and boxes.  Every batch of tents that has been shipped over has quickly sold out. This new revenue stream is allowing the overall business to survive. After four months of helping his dad out, Oliver has finally landed a job in a warehouse, which he'll use to save some money.  Thomas thinks that is no coincidence. Work experience with his dad gave him a renewed sense of purpose. ""There's lots of criticism of kids partying [during coronavirus], but I feel sorry for my son's generation. The social side of life is dead for them,"" says Thomas. ""This period is going to affect them for the rest of their lives, it's in their psyche."" As a dad and entrepreneur, he was just happy he could do something to help out.

Lockdown 2.0 is here: What I bought before the shops closed,,https://www.bbc.com//news/uk-54815677,Covid-19: The last thing I bought before England's lockdown 2.0 - BBC News,"Many shops are closing their doors for four weeks, as England enters a second national lockdown. In June, when stores reopened after the spring national lockdown, we spoke to shoppers about the first thing they bought. Now we're back at the same shopping centre - centre.mk in Milton Keynes - to see what people are stocking up on this time. ""As soon as I knew about lockdown, I went into work on Monday and said 'can I book off Wednesday because I need to go Christmas shopping',"" says Joanne Nixey, 28, from Windsor. She messaged her friend, Chloe Gould, straight away and the pair have been stocking up on Christmas presents and decorations. ""I love funky Christmas decorations so I got a rubber duck and a fish,"" says Chloe. ""It's random. A cushion, some candles. I'm trying to get it all done."" ""It gets us out before lockdown,"" says Joanne, pointing to her Primark bags. Sue Stone also booked some time off of work to get the bulk of her Christmas shopping done. ""Boris knew we had a day off, so luckily he moved the lockdown to Thursday,"" she jokes.  ""It's just the last day before lockdown so it's Christmas shopping,"" says Sue, 52, a company director. She and Lorraine Stonell spent £130 at Hotel Chocolat, as well as bagging perfumes, toiletries and a hoodie. ""I have bought my coffee pods,"" she adds, pointing to a Nespresso bag. ""They are an essential, but the shop will still shut."" ""I got my work bonus so have come shopping,"" says Phil Read, 47, from Bletchley. ""Considering the situation, I'm surprised I got a bonus. I work for the government so a very secure job thankfully."" In his shopping bags are clothes - ""winter clothes, basically"" - including sweaters, pants and some waterproof trousers to play football in. He says the thought of lockdown ""feels rubbish"". ""I have actually got a week off work,"" he says. ""They are forcing us to use our holiday so I took this week off and have been doing all I can in these few days, cramming it in."" ""Everything's half price,"" says Jenny Holloway, 40, referring to the Christmas pop-up shop, where she and her mother Helen McGill bought reindeer decorations for £10 each. ""We are just mother and daughter"", adds Helen, ""and we don't get to spend that much time together anyway because of work, and thinking about lockdown we won't be seeing each other. We are just trying to spend time together today before lockdown. ""It's a happy-sad feeling. Happy that we're out now, but sad for the people in shops. At 5pm the shutters are going to come down and when will they come up again? We were hearing whispers about furlough and I just thought it was really sad."" Elizabeth Morris, 38, and her mother, also called Elizabeth Morris, managed to do all of their Christmas shopping back in September and they are now ""just getting some little bits"". ""We have got some matching pyjamas, to wear for a whole month,"" jokes Elizabeth, holding up the bedwear for her and one-year-old son George. ""It's that last opportunity to go to the shops. It's our last hurrah. Last day before we're grounded again."" On the prospect of another lockdown, Elizabeth, 58, says: ""We are positive about it all now. We look forward to reinstating our walks."" Her daughter adds: ""It's my mum and dad's ruby wedding anniversary in November and we were going to Tenerife but can't now. We are now finding other things to do to celebrate. We'll find something."" ""There's a couple of celebrations in our house at the weekend,"" says childminder Rose Iroegbu, 47. ""My son is 18 on Friday. ""I plan to cook his best delicacy, rice and stew."" She's bought balloons and some surprise gifts for him (she can't tell us what they are to risk spoiling the surprise) as well as a phone charging cable for herself.  ""I feel a mixture of emotions"" about a second lockdown, she says. ""Worry and anxiety about the future."" ""I have done most of my shopping for Christmas,"" says electrician Chris Locke, 41, from Luton. ""I have bought some stuff this morning and put that in my car. I can't carry everything. I'll be finished today, kids as well."" Chris has bought some socks and slippers for his mother-in-law, plus some toys for his children, including Mario Kart Live and some Lego. ""I'm fairly organised, like I always get stuff done before December. But more in advance this year."" ""They don't send it out online,"" says Sarah Bennett, talking about the six rolls of wrapping paper she's just bought from Card Factory, which had a fast-moving queue outside. ""With two kids you need a lot of Christmas paper."" ""We are just getting bits,"" adds Sarah, who runs a cleaning business and has come shopping with her teenage daughter. ""If I like it, I buy it. We got two standing Santas, reduced to £12.99 from the Christmas shop. ""We just came out for a mother and daughter day and we are going to TGI Fridays after.""

All you need to know about Covid-19,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-51048366,Covid symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself? - BBC News,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. If you get just one of them, you should get a test. Public Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one.  If you have any of these symptoms you should get a test as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason.  Anyone you live with, or who is in your support bubble, should also self-isolate until the test result arrives. It takes five days on average from the moment you are infected to start showing the symptoms, but the World Health Organization says it can take up to 14 days. If the test is positive, your whole household must all continue to follow self-isolation rules. No. The coronavirus can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms. Scientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types. Symptoms include: And researchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus infection in children. Lots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu and other infections. This will be a particular problem over winter when these bugs are more common.  Public Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it. However, they should still get a test. If you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started. You must stay away from other members of your household, who must self-isolate for at least 14 days. Most people will have only mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and plenty of fluids. You should not even go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. If you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you cannot speak more than a few words. If you are concerned your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland. The main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen. The most seriously ill patients may require ventilation where the patient is sedated and air is pushed into their lungs. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.  So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. Face coverings are also compulsory in many indoor settings across the UK.

Am I allowed to give my friends a hug?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/uk-51506729,Coronavirus: What are the social distancing rules? - BBC News,"Social distancing remains a key part of the UK's strategy for keeping people safe and preventing the spread of Covid-19. It means keeping a certain distance away from other people to lessen the risk of passing on - or catching - coronavirus. Each nation has slightly different advice:  Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads mainly when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, and transmits small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air.  These droplets can land in other people's mouths or noses nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs. You could also be infected after touching a surface on which the droplets have landed. The risks are far higher indoors than outdoors. Social distancing is a key element of meeting others safely. The only people you do not need to socially distance from are: Otherwise, when seeing anybody else you must: Different restrictions apply across the UK. England is currently under a national lockdown, during which nobody can meet anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors. Children under five don't count. They can meet one other person in an outdoor public place, such as a park. Scotland is moving to a five-tier system of restrictions from Monday, with rules about meeting people different at each level. The lockdown in Wales has now finished. Two households in Wales can now form a bubble and can meet in their own homes, while up to 15 people are allowed to meet for organised activities indoors, and up to 30 outdoors. People living in Northern Ireland are also currently under restrictions. Support bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people from two households.

Who can get a coronavirus test?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-51943612,Coronavirus: How to get a Covid test - BBC News,"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  Liverpool is the first English city to have regular coronavirus testing for all residents, whether they have symptoms or not, as part of a pilot. Testing is considered a key way to control the epidemic, but government's system has experienced setbacks.  Testing people and then tracing the contacts of those infected is vital to stop the disease from spreading.  You should seek a test if you show one of these three key symptoms:  The idea of testing is to find people with the virus and keep them isolated to avoid it being spread through the wider community. Until you can get a test it's important you and your household self-isolate. The testing system experienced plenty of well-publicised problems early on, with people struggling to book.  There were also multiple cases where some people could only book tests many miles from their homes. But the system is running much better now and coping with demand. Roughly 300,000 tests a day on average were processed in the week to 1 November. The government says capacity is more than 500,000, although that number of tests has never actually been carried out in a day.   It has pledged to bring in mass coronavirus testing by the end of the year, even among people with no symptoms. The prime minister has spoken of his desire for 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early 2021, but experts have expressed doubt that this is possible. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the two new testing mega labs - which open in early 2021 - will add 600,000 tests to the UK's daily capacity. The first kind tests to see if you are currently infected. In most cases a nose and throat swab is taken and then sent to be processed at a lab.  There are also rapid turnaround versions of these tests which are mostly available in hospitals. One of the types available uses a technology similar to that of the slower lab tests, but scaled down so it can be processed using a portable machine.  Another, so-called ""lateral flow"" tests - which are being used in the Liverpool pilot - involve a handheld kit that gives a result a bit like a pregnancy test.  Because these miss out the step of amplifying the virus's genetic information, they are less sensitive and will therefore will miss more cases of the virus - especially in people with relatively mild infections.  These lateral flow kits are extremely valuable in areas without big labs, which currently have very little access to any testing at all. But up until recently they haven't been seen as a key part of the UK's testing strategy.  Tests on saliva are also being trialled. The second kind of test involves blood samples and looks for antibodies which indicate past, rather than current, infection.  At the moment, these are mainly being used by scientists to estimate what percentage of the population has had Covid, rather than to diagnose individuals. Private tests can be obtained from clinics and health centres, with some offering a result within three days. Prices vary but are often around £100-£200 for a swab test - which shows if you are currently infected - and £50-£100 for an antibody test, which can indicate a past infection. However antibody tests do not work for everyone - and even some people who have had coronavirus do not have antibodies. Tests must have a ''CE mark'' to show they meet all legal criteria. If you test positive, the test supplier must let your local health authority know so it can trace outbreaks. With the most common type of diagnostic test, scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative - wrongly telling someone they are not infected.  This can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, there were problems in the lab, or because of the stage of infection the patient was at when tested. Each country records testing slightly differently, so like-for-like comparisons won't be 100% accurate.  However, analysis from Our World In Data, a research team  at the University of Oxford, suggests the UK is now performing more tests than many other countries.  For example, on 1 November, the UK carried out 417 tests per 100,000 people. This compares favourably to similar European countries: in France the number was 433 per 100,000 while in Germany it was 232 and in Spain 247 per 100,000 people.  This just tells us the raw numbers, though, and not how many tests were being carried out in proportion to the size of a country's outbreak, or how well the tests were targeted.

Why did test-and-trace app contact its boss?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/explainers-52442754,Coronavirus: How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? - BBC News,"Baroness Dido Harding, the head of NHS Test and Trace, is self-isolating after receiving a notification from its app. Last week her husband, Conservative MP John Penrose, was also told to isolate by the app, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolating at No 10 after NHS Test and Trace contacted him. Mr Johnson spent about 35 minutes with MP Lee Anderson, who lost his sense of taste the next day. Refusing to self-isolate when told to is now illegal in England, with fines of up to £10,000. You can download the app on a smartphone - but not on tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go to Android's Google Play or Apple's App Store and search for ""NHS Covid-19"". Your phone must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. Some more recent Huawei phones will not load the app either. The app can detect when a fellow app user is nearby. When two phones running the app are near each other, they will make contact through Bluetooth.    If they are close for a long enough time, and one of the two owners later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.  You can also use the app to check in at venues - for instance, shops, bars, restaurants or places of worship. Hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will be asked to display posters with a QR code, which app users will be able to scan.  The posters will also go up in communal areas of community buildings such as universities, hospitals and libraries.   Used alongside manual contact tracing, the app will help identify close contacts of a user who tests positive, or visitors to a premises that has suffered an outbreak.  Northern Ireland launched an app in July, while Scotland's app was launched in September. People who display coronavirus symptoms and test positive have been contacted by text, email or phone. England's NHS Test and Trace service calls only from 0300 0135 000. They are asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website and give personal information, including:  Close contacts are:  Contact must have taken place within a nine-day period, starting 48 hours before symptoms appeared.  No-one who is then contacted will be told your identity. If you are approached because one of your contacts has tested positive, you must stay at home for 14 days from your last point of contact with them.  You must self-isolate, even if you don't have symptoms. Others in your household won't have to self-isolate unless they also develop symptoms, but must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. The prime minister claimed the UK's test and trace system would be ""world-beating"". But it has encountered several problems since its launch in May.  Of those transferred to the contact tracing system between 29 October and 4 November in England, 85.0% were reached and asked to provide information about their contacts. This has remained broadly similar since Test and Trace began, although increased slightly, over the past month. For those where communication details were available, 78.3% were reached and asked to self-isolate. Sage, which advises the government, has said that at least 80% of contacts would need to isolate for it to work properly. The mobile app was meant to launch in mid-May and form a key component of the UK's tracing strategy. But the original attempt, which used a ''centralised'' approach to storing data, had to be abandoned. An NHS Test and Trace call does not always mean a pub or restaurant must close. It depends on the circumstances and when the infected person visited.

Where do I have to wear a mask?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/health-51205344,Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? - BBC News,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online People around the UK must now wear face coverings in many public places. But what protection do they offer, and what sort of coverings can be worn? Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.  They should mainly be worn to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself.  When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission.  They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms, or are yet to develop them. There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing. Face coverings are now compulsory across the UK when: People can be refused travel for not following the rules or fined as a last resort. In England, the police can issue a £200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a £60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. In England and Scotland, face coverings are also compulsory in a number of indoor spaces, including:  Scotland also requires face coverings to be worn in indoor spaces, such as staff canteens and corridors in workplaces. It no longer requires couples to wear them when exchanging marriage vows. In Wales, face coverings must be worn in all indoor public places by customers and staff.  In Northern Ireland, they must be worn in ""any other indoor place where goods or services are available to buy or rent"". Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include: You can remove your mask if: Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation. The government does not recommend wearing face coverings in schools and colleges because of the controls already in place. However, each nation is adopting different rules: However, they will be mandatory for schools in parts of England that are under local restrictions, but not in classrooms.   The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.  The government has issued its own advice too. Face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection as the masks that healthcare workers wear.  World Health Organization (WHO) advice says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. They help us protect each other and reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms, or are yet to develop symptoms.

Does the US have the worst coronavirus death rate?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-53780196,Coronavirus: Is the US the worst-hit country for deaths? - BBC News,"By Jake Horton, Becky Dale & Nassos StylianouBBC Reality Check & Data Journalism  As coronavirus cases continue to rise in the US, there are competing narratives about the impact of the disease. President Trump claims the country has one of the lowest death rates from the virus in the world. He's also said excess deaths are significantly lower than elsewhere - that's the number of extra deaths above what would be expected. But others say the US has been hit worse than other countries, pointing out it has the most recorded Covid deaths of any country in the world. ""More than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst performance of any nation on earth,"" Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden has said. We've looked at three different ways you can measure the rate of Covid-19 deaths, two of which show that while the US is not the worst affected, it's among those most badly hit. First, there is no international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. And making comparisons is tricky as countries record deaths in different ways.  But experts say one of the most telling measures is how many extra deaths a country experiences above the number who would have been expected to die.  This ""excess"" death data captures some potentially unrecorded coronavirus deaths, and other deaths that might be the result of strain on healthcare systems and other indirect effects of the epidemic.  It can therefore provide a more complete picture of how a country has been affected overall. Most developed countries publish excess death data, but they do it less frequently than the daily coronavirus death totals they provide. The US experienced almost 200,000 excess deaths from the start of the outbreak up to 11 July, according to the latest data available. That's an 18% increase on previous years. Although the time periods are different, looking at the latest data from the world's leading industrialised nations, we can see the US has a lower proportion of excess deaths so far than Italy and the UK. The UK has been one of the hardest hit countries, with around 26% more deaths than expected in a typical year up to the start of August. So on this measure with the data available so far, the US is not the hardest-hit country, but this figure could change.  While weekly deaths in the UK and Italy have gone back to expected levels, the US could move up the rankings if it continues to see above-expected numbers of deaths each week.  Another measure is the case fatality rate. This is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of those who tested positive for coronavirus, how many have died?  President Trump has said: ""Our case fatality rate has continued to decline, and is lower than the European Union, and almost everywhere else in the world."" The US rate is relatively low compared with most major European countries, including the UK, although it isn't the lowest in the world. But different countries are testing to find coronavirus cases in different ways, meaning this is a hard comparison to make. A low case fatality rate could mean that widespread testing identifies lots of mild cases who were unlikely to die in the first place.  The US has recorded the most deaths from coronavirus in the world, but it has a larger population than many other countries. When you look at deaths per capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst-hit countries. The US has recorded more than 52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - there are a number of countries that have recorded more. The US continues to regularly report more than 1,000 new coronavirus deaths a day, which is one of the highest daily death rates per capita in the world, according to the UK-based Our World in Data website which compiles global figures for coronavirus. However, there are important differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making exact comparisons difficult.

"No, these tests don't damage the brain",,https://www.bbc.com//news/53443429,Coronavirus tests: Swabs don't damage the brain and other claims fact-checked - BBC News,"By Jack Goodman and Flora CarmichaelBBC Reality Check Claims that coronavirus tests can harm people are circulating on social media. We investigated the claims in some of the most widely shared posts. A picture showing a swab test being taken has been circulated widely on Facebook and Instagram along with claims that the swab is taken at the ""blood-brain barrier"".  The idea you could access the blood-brain barrier through a swab up the nose is a complete misunderstanding of what it is and how it works.  The brain has lots of layers of protection. First and mostly obviously is the skull and within that, the brain is further encased in a protective membrane and fluid.  Within the blood vessels that line the brain, the blood-brain barrier is a tightly packed layer of cells that stops molecules circulating in the blood from passing into the brain, while allowing in things like oxygen and nutrients.  A swab stick inserted into the nose would need to break through multiple layers of tissue and drill through a bone and into the blood vessels to reach the blood-brain barrier.  ""The swab cannot reach the blood brain barrier without significant force that breaks several layers of tissue and bone. We have not seen any complications from Covid swabs in our neurology practice"", says Dr Liz Coulthard, a committee member of the British Neuroscience Association (BNA). The nasopharyngeal swab checks for coronavirus in the back of the nasal passage and is one of a range of swabbing techniques.  A combined nose-and-throat swab is routinely used to test for Covid-19 in the UK. ""I have swabbed many patients while working in hospital and also do these swabs on myself every week as a volunteer in a trial. It is unusual to have something that far up your nose - the swab can feel itchy or tickly but it shouldn't be painful,"" says Dr Tom Wingfield of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The false claims started to emerge in US-based Facebook accounts on 6 July and some versions include calls to refuse testing altogether. Some of these have been rated ""false"" by fact-checking organisations on Facebook.  We've found the same graphic appearing in Romanian, French, Dutch and Portuguese posts, each generating thousands of engagements.  Reports of contaminated test kits have been misinterpreted to imply that taking a test will give you coronavirus.  In fact, headlines shared about contamination refer to a report on ineffective tests caused by sloppy lab practices at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) early in the pandemic. This doesn't mean that being tested will give you the virus. In a post shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook this week, a fan page for Fox News host Tucker Carlson shared a news article about contaminated test kits saying: ""You want Covid-19? This is how U get it!""  The full Washington Post article, which was published in June, details the findings of a federal review which found that faulty tests and lab procedures caused delays to the rollout of the CDC's testing programme. It doesn't suggest that faulty test kits could have passed on the virus to any patients. The article is behind a pay wall, which means most people seeing posts sharing the article would read the headline out of context. Fact checkers in the US and India have debunked wilder claims that the coronavirus test is a plot funded by the Gates Foundation to implant a microchip into patients. These false claims, shared thousands of times on Facebook, are similar to conspiracy theories we looked into previously about a sinister micro-chipping programme linked to a potential vaccine.  There is no evidence to suggest there is any micro-chipping programme linked to the coronavirus pandemic and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has denied the claims. A meme asking, ""If Covid was really carried on your breath, why can't you just breathe on the swab? Why do they have to shove the swab to the very back of your nose?"" has been engaged with at least 7,000 times on Facebook and Instagram.  Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. This doesn't mean that just breathing on a swab would collect enough material to conduct a laboratory test though. We spoke to Public Health England about this who say taking a swab from inside the nose or throat yields more accurate test results.  If you only breathe on a slim swab head, you might not catch the viral particles or the cells that carry the virus. However, if you insert the swab in the nose and throat and rotate it at the site of infection, you are more likely to get infectious material that will yield a result. Finally, we've taken a look at the growing scandal in Bangladesh of faked certificates indicating a person does not have coronavirus. Several people have been arrested there for issuing bogus documentation showing negative test results to people who haven't actually been tested.  These documents have value because they are often required by migrant workers to show that they are virus-free when they arrive at their destination. Bangladesh relies heavily on income from its citizens working overseas. In the latest incident, a hospital owner, accused of falsifying thousands of tests, was detained after a nine-day hunt near the Indian border, disguised as a woman.  Criminal gangs are also putting adverts on social media to find potential buyers.  Strangely, fake certificates indicating positive tests are also reported to be on sale in Bangladesh - offering up the chance for public servants to take leave from work.

The human cost of India's coronavirus fake news,,https://www.bbc.com//news/world-asia-india-53165436,Coronavirus: The human cost of fake news in India - BBC News,"By Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Fake or misleading news can have a real impact on those who find themselves the targets. This has been a particular problem in India during the coronavirus pandemic, where reliable sources of news are frequently drowned out by unverified information online. False information has had serious consequences for minority communities as well as some business sectors such as the meat industry. The Reality Check team has looked at the extent of this misinformation and some of those directly affected. India's religious fault lines are an important theme across false stories spreading online, something that has been further highlighted by the coronavirus outbreak. We've looked back at claims debunked by five Indian fact-checking websites between January and June this year. They fall under four broad headings:  Of the 1,447 fact-checks on five Indian websites, claims around coronavirus dominated, making up 58% of them. This was largely related to false cures, lockdown rumours and conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus. In the period between January and early March (before the coronavirus outbreak took hold), fake news was dominated by the Citizenship Amendment Act, a new law that offers citizenship to people from three neighbouring countries, but only if they are not Muslim. The law led to protests across the country by those who said it would marginalise Muslims. Riots in mainly Muslim neighbourhoods in north-east Delhi in February also fuelled a lot of misleading claims around that time. This included doctored videos, fake images, the reusing of old videos and images in a different context, fake messages, and messages with fake attributions. Our analysis found that misinformation targeting Muslims spiked in the first week of April. This was after several members of an Islamic group called the Tablighi Jamaat, who had attended a religious gathering in Delhi, tested positive. As more members of the group tested positive, false claims about Muslims deliberately spreading the virus became viral. In several parts of the country, there were calls for an economic boycott of Muslim businesses. Vegetable seller Imran - who didn't want to use his real name - told the BBC that when a fake video on WhatsApp said to show a Muslim man spitting on bread went viral, calls for a boycott of Muslims grew. ""We were scared to enter villages where we would usually go to sell vegetables,"" said Imran, who lives in Uttar Pradesh state. Imran and other vegetable vendors from his community now only sell their produce at a city market. In the capital Delhi, the Minorities Commission, which works to safeguard the rights of minority communities, formally notified the police of the need to act against people stopping Muslims from entering residential areas or carrying on with their business. ""Not only people who were associated with the Tablighi Jamaat [were attacked], there were attacks on Muslims in all parts of India,"" Zafarul Islam, the chairman of the commission, told the BBC.  False claims were also widely spread in India that eating vegetarian food and eliminating meat from your diet could prevent you getting coronavirus. The government launched campaigns to stop the spread of such misinformation. These false WhatsApp messages and social media posts had an impact on both Muslim and non-Muslim groups alike who were involved in the meat industry. The Indian authorities made an assessment that by April, misinformation about meat-eating generally had contributed to losses of up to 130bn rupees (£1.43bn) in the poultry industry.  Poultry is one of the main forms of meat consumed in India. ""We were giving away chicken for free because we didn't know what to do with the stock,"" said Sujit Prabhavle, a meat trader in the western state of Maharashtra. ""Our sales fell by 80%,"" he said. ""I saw a message on WhatsApp that said eating chicken would spread coronavirus, so people stopped buying meat,"" said Touhid Baraskar, another meat seller from Maharashtra. Some of the most viral false information has included fake claims that former top Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar had asked for meat shops to be shut.  ""When misinformation comes from sources they trust, people will believe whatever comes their way without fact-checking it,"" said Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt-News, a fact-checking website. The meat industry was not the only victim of fake news. The fall in sales in the poultry industry had a major knock-on effect on the sale of eggs and of maize - which goes into much of the feed for chickens.  The sale of eggs fell by 30% in Delhi, 21% in Mumbai and by 52% in Hyderabad in Telangana state between January and June, according to official data.  Maize farmers are now selling their produce up to 35% lower than the minimum support price offered by the Indian government as a result of the fall in demand.

Is Trump right to say US does 'the greatest testing'?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/world-us-canada-53221801,Coronavirus: Has China or the US tested more? - BBC News,"By Reality Check teamBBC News US President Donald Trump says the US has done the ""greatest testing"" in the world - but Chinese state media says China has carried out three times more tests than the US. So who's right? ""We have more cases because we do the greatest testing... Other countries, they don't test millions."" The US has carried out almost 31 million coronavirus tests, according to the latest data. That is more than any other Western country, but significantly less than China's reported total of over 90 million. Exact testing comparisons can be difficult. Some countries count the number of people tested, while others count the total number of tests as someone can be tested several times if the first test doesn't work properly. The US largely reports people tested, but some states report the total of tests carried out. China's reported total is of the number of tests conducted. ""Throughout China, the number a week ago was 90.41 million, three times the number in the US."" In a tweet containing these figures, Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a state media outlet, also called President Trump's claim that the US had carried out the most tests a ""pure lie"". The Chinese National Health Committee's data, which is compiled by the Chinese government and cannot be independently verified, confirms, as of 22 June, China had conducted 90.41 million tests. So the total is roughly three times the amount in the US, but China has a much larger population. Based on these figures, China has carried out about one test for every 15 people, compared with about one in 11 in the US. So that's slightly more per head of population in the US. And China's testing has been more localised, with over a third of tests carried out in Beijing, Wuhan and the most populated province, Guangdong, according to local reports. The methods of testing are also different in the two countries.  China's daily testing capacity has rapidly increased thanks to batch testing - grouping samples together and carrying out individual tests only if a batch proves positive. Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House's top infectious disease expert, has said the US is ""seriously considering"" this method. But it would work only in regions where the number of infections is low, as it is inefficient if a high proportion of the batches test positive.

Why are there outbreaks in meat processing plants?,,https://www.bbc.com//news/53137613,Coronavirus: Why have there been so many outbreaks in meat processing plants? - BBC News,"By Anthony ReubenBBC Reality Check Hundreds of workers have tested positive for coronavirus at meat processing plants and abattoirs. They include a chicken processing site in Anglesey, where more than 150 workers have become infected with Covid-19, and plants in Wrexham and West Yorkshire. There have also been major outbreaks in Germany, France, Spain and the US. Bev Clarkson from the union Unite, says: ""Unite has warned time and again that coronavirus outbreaks at meat processing factories throughout the UK were likely"". People get infected with coronavirus from droplets, which may be coughed, sneezed or exhaled by an infected person.  The infection may come through close contact with the person or by touching infected surfaces. ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick. ""Virus-containing droplets from infected individuals are more likely to spread, settle and stay viable."" Another possible factor in these refrigerated workplaces is noisy machinery, which requires people to talk more loudly or shout, which can increase the spread of infected droplets. It is difficult to keep workers two metres apart when they are working on fast-moving production lines, and the absence of daylight may also help the virus to survive. ""When you have people standing right next to each other working heavily - because of course this is a difficult job - and breathing heavily, you have a chance for spreading virus from just one infected individual to many that are in close proximity,"" said Tara Smith, professor of epidemiology at Kent State University in Ohio. ""And then of course you have a chain of dominoes after that."" There is no evidence that the meat products themselves could be a source of Covid-19 infection at the plants. The Food Standards Agency said it was very unlikely that you could catch coronavirus from food because that is not how it is known to be transmitted. It's not just conditions inside the plant that may be increasing the risk of coronavirus.  ""Some of these factories have on-site or nearby accommodation where there are several people in each dormitory. They may be transported on a bus to the site of work, and they will be indoors together all day,"" said Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. The Unite union says that while it represents many workers in the meat processing sector, plants often employ migrant workers who may not be entitled to full sick pay, so could lose money if they self-isolate after getting sick.  The union says they often do not speak English as a first language and are worried about losing their jobs, so may be reluctant to raise concerns. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) told Reality Check that most workers in its members' plants are full employees rather than agency staff. The government has issued guidelines on working safely in food manufacturing - including keeping workers at least two metres apart when possible. The BMPA has also issued guidance, including cleaning factories more often than usual, isolating staff who develop symptoms and staggering start times and break times. It also suggests providing additional personal protective equipment (PPE) such as visors, if available - staff in meat processing facilities usually wear PPE, but that does not necessarily include masks.  Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said the organisation had been advising on a number of outbreaks in factories, some of which involved meat processing. ""Where outbreaks occur, we are working closely with NHS Test and Trace to ensure appropriate testing and tracing of contacts, both within and outside of the workplace. Where required, mobile testing units are being deployed to ensure large workforces are tested promptly."" In Germany, the government is banning the outsourcing of abattoir staff - workers will have to be employed directly by the company. A source close to Defra in the UK told the BBC that another of the factors being looked at in Germany is the poor training and poor language skills of the mainly Eastern European workforce in the meat processing industry, which was preventing the rules being followed. A report from the Center for Disease Control in the US has recommended slowing production lines, putting physical barriers between staff, making everybody wear face coverings and ensuring that nobody would lose money because of self-isolating.

Why learning to code isn't a fix-all,,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201117-why-reskilling-wont-always-guarantee-you-a-new-job,Why reskilling won’t always guarantee you a new job - BBC Worklife," Menu When London went into lockdown in March, Baltasar Romero quickly realised his job as a reservations manager might be in trouble. The team he was managing was cut from 10 people to just one, and his hours were reduced by a third. “It was clear that working in hospitality was going to be quite difficult for the next few years,” says the 34-year-old. “In August, they made my position redundant. So they made it very easy for me to just jump into a radical change.” In September, he started a three-month, full-time software-engineering course. He says a change had been in the cards for some time, and the pandemic was just the push he needed. Romero adds that his affinity for technology seemed to make the career a good fit, but the regular calls from the industry for more coders certainly helped make his decision. “It seems that sooner or later everybody should jump into this environment,” he says. As the pandemic has put millions out of work and is hastening the reshaping of entire industries, workers around the world are seeing signals that new skills will be the key to steady employment in the 'new normal'. For example, in September, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans aimed at upskilling workers in the form of free college courses, digital-skills bootcamps and more apprenticeships to “build back better from coronavirus”. In September, Baltasar Romero started a three-month, full-time software-engineering course to transition from his job in hospitality (Credit: Baltasar Romero) But experts say there’s little point training millions of people in new technical skills if there aren’t enough jobs at the end of it. “It could work for an individual, but it doesn't work as an economic policy,” says Gordon Lafer, a political economist at the University of Oregon. “Every time there's an economic problem job training is trotted out… and it's never worked."" The pandemic was still a few months away when 42-year-old Claire Winterbottom, from Leeds, started her reskilling journey. She had taken adoption leave from her job as a debt advisor, and decided to use the time to retrain as a web developer. She’d always been interested in technology, but was also keen to “future-proof” herself. In January, she secured a place on a free four-month course aimed at women. She was told all but two of the previous cohort had secured technology jobs. But this year’s course finished in April, at the peak of the pandemic’s first wave, and nearly seven months later only four of her class of 16 have found work in the industry. Winterbottom says it’s hardly surprising as the recession bites, and demand for new developers dries up. “You're also up against other people who've taken the pandemic to learn how to code. So, there’s more people with more skills, but there's less jobs,” she adds. The idea that the precarious position workers find themselves in today could be solved by training is particularly illogical, says Lafer, who has been studying job-training schemes in the US since the 1980s. People are out of work because the pandemic has shuttered huge swathes of the economy, not because of a lack of skills. “If job training was ever going to work it's not now,” he says. But even before the pandemic, the narrative of reskilling was on shaky ground. As the twin forces of globalisation and technological progress have eroded well-paid blue-collar jobs and routine office work, governments have regularly promoted it as the solution. The logic is that as industries like manufacturing decline and others like IT boom, there’s a growing gap between the skills employers need and those of workers, particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) related fields. Teaching workers in-demand skills, such as coding, could therefore kill two birds with one stone: meeting industry needs while helping displaced workers revamp their careers. But the evidence doesn’t back up the assertion of a ‘skills gap’. Former US Department of Labor chief economist Heidi Shierholz has pointed out that the clearest signal of such a problem would be occupations with a combination of low unemployment and strong wage growth, reflecting competition for those with in-demand skills. But this evidence is consistently lacking; in 2018, only occupations in the legal field came close. In reality, employers report difficulty hiring because the wages they offer don’t match the skills they’re after, she says. (Credit: Claire Winterbottom) If anything, the numbers point to an oversupply of skills, says Hal Salzman, a sociologist at Rutgers University. In a 2018 paper, he and colleagues showed that only about 60 to 70% of US computing and engineering graduates land jobs in STEM, dropping to between 10 and 50% for those studying life sciences, physical sciences and maths. A study from the Office for National Statistics published last year recorded similar evidence in the UK that a shortage of skills is not the issue. The data showed that 16% of workers in 2017 were overeducated for their jobs, which rose to 31% for graduates. Lafer says that part of the problem is that the occupations people are typically encouraged to retrain for represent a small fraction of total jobs, and that in many places, technology is being used to automate tasks to eliminate the need for trained employees. Why, then, do policymakers and business leaders continue to focus on reskilling? Lafer thinks it gives them an easy way out by laying the blame for workers’ dim employment prospects on their failure to acquire the right skills rather than facing up to deeper structural changes in the economy. He says that a better option might be a push for better pay and conditions in other in demand industries that employ lots of people but are poorly rewarded such as construction, healthcare and education. But that debate is contentious, he admits. For Marcela Escobari at the Brookings Institution, the focus on reskilling is less a ‘conspiracy’ against workers than a tangle of misaligned incentives and over-eagerness for a silver bullet. Last December, she and colleagues published a report called Realism About Reskilling, which concluded that a myopic focus on skills obscures the numerous other barriers that can trap workers in dead-end jobs. “There's definitely places where skills matter. But there's a lot of other reasons why people are churning through low-wage jobs that don't see any mobility,” she says. When they studied real-world job transitions, they found most didn’t require retraining. It was more about picking the right industry to move into, either because their existing skills were a good match or demand was high in their area. She and colleagues created an online tool that uses real-world data on job transitions to tell people what roles others in their occupation and area have successfully moved to. They also hope employers will look at the results to work out what industries they should be hiring from. She says policymakers should focus on making these kinds of transitions easier. That could include creating portable benefits that allow workers to take things like health plans and retirement plans with them when they switch employers, but also incentivising employers to create more entry level positions and reverse decades of funding cuts to internal training schemes. After Stefanie Lis was furloughed from her restaurant job amid the pandemic, she studied coding online (Credit: Nick Olexyn) But she says there also needs to be more effort to remove barriers for those in genuine need of reskilling who are typically the least able to access it. For low-wage workers, it often comes down to simple logistics: being able to take time off work, or having a car to get to training classes. And because reskilling programs are often measured on their outcomes, they frequently screen candidates to select those most likely to succeed. That’s not to say reskilling is a universally bad idea for individuals. Stefanie Lis, 28, was put on furlough from her restaurant job in Leeds during the pandemic, and used the time to study coding online. Three months later, she secured a paid internship with Manchester web development company Huddle, which has since turned into a job. She’s adamant that the huge amount of free or cheap online resources available today means anyone can learn to code if they put their mind to it. But she is conscious that the furlough allowed her to treat learning as a full-time job, and she was lucky to find an employer willing to take on a fledgling developer. “They've just really taken the time to be patient and show me things and support me."" Despite her struggles so far, Winterbottom is also confident she will eventually find work as a developer. But if she does, she says it’ll be down to her passion for coding, not to mention the fact she’s already employed and doesn’t have to worry about bills piling up. She adds that there’s no way it makes sense for everyone, and she thinks its disingenuous for politicians to suggest that this is the answer to the havoc the pandemic has wrought on the job market. “You've got to work so hard at it and do all these extra activities and just immerse yourself fully. Without that passion, I can't see them getting anywhere.”"
Have you ever experienced shemomechama?,,https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20201124-shemomechama-the-word-for-when-you-cant-stop-eating,BBC - Travel - The untranslatable word for overeating," In Georgia, known for its epic feasts and toasts, people often experience shemomechama, an untranslatable word for when you are full but you continue eating anyway. I raised my glass of wine like a beleaguered boxer who’d just been proclaimed the winner after 12 rounds of fighting. Around me, 10 other people also had their glass raised as the man at the head of the table gave a toast. And then, as expected, we slammed back the amber-coloured wine and I surveyed a long table stacked with food. This wasn’t the first toast of the day. It wasn’t even the second. Sixteenth? Twenty-fifth? I’d lost count.  It’s when you didn’t intend to eat so much but you accidentally did  Welcome to a supra, a traditional Georgian feast. In the Republic of Georgia, these epic meals are put on for special occasions or, in this case, no real reason at all. I was in the mountainous Racha region in the north-western part of the country, and in front of me was a lush bounty of Georgian dishes: whole trout doused in walnut sauce; a rich pork-studded bean stew called lobio; baked cheese-bread called khachapuri; blackberry-slathered chicken; lamb stew; chicken with a creamy garlic sauce called shkmeruli; and, in typical Georgian fashion, three different kinds of bread – in what turned out to be a five-hour eating and drinking extravaganza at the home of a friend of a friend.  There was not enough space for the copious amounts of food on the long, rectangular table, so the women of the house started stacking food-loaded dishes on top of each other, sometimes four plates high. It’s not unusual that during these feasts tables will buckle over thanks to the weight set upon them; a hit-you-over-the-head metaphor if there ever was one. It wasn’t just the wine that made me feel dazed and confused. I was in a serious food coma. Or, more specifically I was experiencing shemomechama, an untranslatable Georgian word. Mako Kavtaradze, founder of the Tbilisi-based Museum of Recipes, told me, “For Georgians, shemomechama means when you are full but you continue eating, you overdose on food.” But more specifically, as Meri Gubeladze, celebrity chef and owner of perpetually packed Tbilisi restaurant Shavi Lomi said, “It’s when you didn’t intend to eat so much but you accidentally did. Usually it’s when something tasted so good that you couldn’t resist. You blame it on the food – and not the eater – for tasting so good.” And it happens much more than you’d think. “I love this word,” said Tekuna Gachechiladze, chef and owner of the lauded Tbilisi restaurant Culinarium Khasheria. “I don’t remember the first time I heard this word but the experience of shemomechama occurs frequently. It usually happens at a late-night dining experience, when, after a long day of working in the kitchen, I suddenly end up at a late supra, or traditional feast. And even though I may not be hungry at all, I eat and eat, and the experience is mixed in with Georgian singing, laughter, wine drinking and then voila! Shemomechama happens.”  Gubeladze added: “You know how much food Georgians put on table when there’s is a supra... So, most of the time, you are full pretty often but then you keep eating because tasty dishes appear endlessly.” The word shemomechama and its meaning is inexorably linked to the supra – after all, achieving shemomechama at a supra is inevitable, as there’s such a bounty of edible delights you wonder how the entire population doesn’t have gout.  You may also be interested in:• Georgia’s giant dumpling born from conquest• The world’s largest walnut harvest• Georgia’s addictive cousin to pizza  There is a certain ‘come hither’ quality to Georgian food that makes it irresistible  That may be a huge reason why this word developed in and around a culinary culture like Georgia’s. “There is a certain ‘come hither’ quality to Georgian food that makes it irresistible, and in the context of a feast, when so many different dishes are on the table, it’s always tempting to eat just a little more than you need, because meals always seem to feel like a celebration there,” said Darra Goldstein, author of The Georgian Feast. “Physically, it’s a feeling of having eaten enough (sometimes more than enough) but not being able to resist one last little bite, so that the flavours will linger on the tongue. But the key to understanding shemomechama is that the word signals a lack of intention – it really is as though something compels you to eat just a bit more, even though you don’t really mean to. It just kind of happens.”  Carla Capalbo, author of Tasting Georgia, says, “One of the main ‘rules’ of the supra is that the serving platters should be constantly replenished, and the guest leaves a table as abundantly full as they sat down to, so to ‘accidentally’ eat it all up is quite a challenge.” Food and drink are often linked to a nation’s identity, especially as a way of distinguishing itself from others – often a foreign, occupying power. In Georgia, there’s a powerful link between food and national awareness. Especially when it comes to the long history of Russian dominance in the region, which began when the Tsarist-led empire invaded Georgia in 1801 and continued through the Soviet era until 1991. “Since the Russians, unlike former invaders, shared the same religion as the Georgians, religion was no longer a distinguishing factor between ‘us’ (the Georgians) and ‘them’ (the Russians),” writes anthropologist Florian Mühlfried in Sharing the Same Blood – Culture and Cuisine in the Republic of Georgia, published in the Anthropology of Food journal. “The ‘self-othering’ of the Georgian nation had to be based on something else: folk culture. The supra soon became a symbol of that cultural otherness, a manifestation of ‘Georgian’ hospitality based on a distinct way of eating, drinking and feasting. It remained a prime cultural marker of national identity well into Soviet times, embodying resistance to becoming a Societas Sovietica. For post-Soviet Georgians, the supra seems to offer permanent counter-assurance of cultural authenticity in the face of an all-levelling globalisation.”  Kevin Tuite, an anthropologist from the University of Montreal, who has heavily researched culture in the Caucasus, breaks down the semantics of the word: “In a sense, the verb ‘eat’” – or ‘chama’ – “becomes passive, and the subject a sort of indirect object: ‘it got eaten, and I was somehow involved’, more or less. Georgian has quite a few such indirect-involvement verbs, such as shemoexarjeba (I burned through my money without realising it) and shemoesriseba (it [some object in my hand] unintentionally got crushed).”  It got eaten, and I was somehow involved  Mülfried, via email, added: “The main thrust of the word lies in the fact that it ascribes agency to the object rather than the subject. It is an expression of being overwhelmed, similar to the way Georgians express being in love: I am the object, the other is the subject. Somebody, something overwhelmed me. This can be a feeling as well, being overwhelmed by hatred that could turn into violence. Something came over me, and this makes me a victim; in the case of shemomechama, a victim of food that is tasty beyond resistibility.”  How, though, could such a word have been born out of this food culture? “The only conclusion I can come to is that Georgians don’t like to take responsibility for their own actions,” said Gubeladze. We often blame it on 70 years of Soviet occupation, where the state was making every decision for you. But also, it’s easier to blame shemomechama than to admit that you’re a pig!”   I definitely felt like a pig by the time the supra had finished. My friends and I walked back to our guest house in silence, as the shemomechama had long set in. When we got there, the guest-house owner insisted we needed to be fed. We pleaded with her that we couldn’t eat any more, but she was adamant. After all, in Georgia they say that a “guest is a gift from God”. And so, with that, we sat down at a table in the courtyard and began a new feast all over again; the shemomechama would be sticking around for a few more hours.  Why We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.

Japan’s most infamous writer?,,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201124-yukio-mishima-the-strange-tale-of-japans-infamous-novelist,Yukio Mishima: The strange tale of Japan’s infamous novelist - BBC Culture," Menu Standing on a balcony, as if on stage, the small, immaculate figure appeals to the army assembled below. The figure is Yukio Mishima, real name Kimitake Hiraoka. He was Japan’s most famous living novelist when, on 25 November 1970, he went to an army base in Tokyo, kidnapped the commander, had him assemble the garrison, then tried to start a coup. He railed against the US-backed state and constitution, berated the soldiers for their submissiveness and challenged them to return the Emperor to his pre-war position as living god and national leader. The audience, at first politely quiet, or just stunned into silence, soon drowned him out with jeers. Mishima stepped back inside and said: “I don’t think they heard me.” Then he knelt down and killed himself by seppuku, the Samurai’s ritual suicide. More like this: -       The best books of 2020 -       The mysterious appeal of the labyrinth -       Why don’t we appreciate funny writing? Mishima’s death shocked the Japanese public. He was a literary celebrity, a macho and provocative but also rather ridiculous character, perhaps akin to Norman Mailer in the US, or Michel Houellebecq in today’s France. But what had seemed to be posturing had suddenly become very real. It was the morning of the opening of the 64th session of the Diet, Japan’s parliament, and the Emperor himself was present. The prime minister’s speech on the government agenda for the coming year was somewhat overshadowed. No one had died by seppuku since the last days of World War Two. This photograph – taken a few days before his death – shows Mishima with his loyal cadets (Credit: Getty Images) “Some thought he had gone mad, others that this was the last in a series of exhibitionistic acts, one more expression of the desire to shock for which he had become notorious,” wrote the Japanese philosopher Hide Ishiguro in a 1975 essay for The New York Review. “A few people on the political right saw his death as a patriotic gesture of protest against present-day Japan. Others believed that it was a despairing, gruesome farce contrived by a talented man who had been an enfant terrible and who could not bear to live on into middle age and mediocrity.” For his part, Mishima once told his wife that “even if I am not immediately understood, it’s OK, because I’ll be understood by the Japan of 50 or 100 years’ time.” In 1949, Mishima arrived on Japan’s literary scene with Confessions of a Mask, a kind of autobiography, thinly veiled as a novel, that made him famous in his early twenties. It tells the story of a delicate, sensitive boy who is all but held captive by his grandmother. She is ill and he is made to nurse her. Rather than playing outside with other boys, he is confined with her for years in the sickly-sweet smelling darkness of her bedroom. Mishima spent part of his childhood living with his grandmother – an experience that he immortalised in the 1949 novel Confessions of a Mask (Credit: Alamy) The boy’s mind develops in that room. Fantasy and reality are never quite separated; fantasy, the stronger twin, grows dominant. By the time the grandmother dies and the boy emerges, he has developed a fixation with roleplaying, with life as theatre. He cannot resist layering fantasies over life around him. Men and boys, especially muscular, straightforward ones, are assigned roles in his vivid, often violent daydreams. Meanwhile he obsesses over his own deviance and appearing normal. He learns how to play his own role: “The reluctant masquerade had begun.” Beauty and destruction Confessions of a Mask continues up to the end of the boy’s adolescence, detailing the entwined evolution of his internal and external lives and his homosexual awakening. In many ways, it is the key to understanding Mishima’s later life and works. It reveals the roots of the aesthetic sensibility, so tied to his sexuality, which proved to be Mishima’s steering obsession. The narrator writes that he “sensuously accepted the creed of death that was popular during the war”, when conscription and self-sacrifice seemed certain and imminent, and indeed Mishima was forever fixated on the idea that beauty is most beautiful when it is transient – and above all on the cusp of destruction. This creed mingles with admiration for the male form, a form the frail narrator lacks, to produce fantasies of brave warriors and their bloody demises. This private world of “Night and Blood and Death” was filled with the “most sophisticated of cruelties and the most exquisite of crimes”, all recounted with a cool detachment. But then Confessions of a Mask also suggests the slippery interplay between performance and reality that characterised everything Mishima did and wrote. It gave the impression of revealing the author locked in some dark struggle with himself – while also suggesting it may just be a masterful manipulation of media and publicity. Mishima had it both ways, scandalising society while retaining a wisp of deniability. Mishima was strongly influenced by European culture and philosophy, including Nietzsche and the late Romantics (Credit: Getty Images) The formula worked. It turned Mishima into the enfant terrible of postwar Japanese literature and won him a broad readership at home. He was, though decadent, a disciplined and prolific writer, churning out reams of popular fiction alongside high literature and dozens of Noh plays. He worked himself into Tokyo high society with the same focus, cultivating a dandyish image. His face, with its rugged bones and soft eyes, photographed well. And he was a friend to foreign bureaux and their correspondents, ingratiating himself and doing what he could to extend his celebrity across the Pacific – with some success. “If Sony’s Akio Morita was the most famous Japanese abroad,” wrote John Nathan, a translator and later a biographer of Mishima’s, “Mishima ran a close second.” Mishima’s novels during the 50s mostly mined the same suggestively autobiographical vein as Confessions of a Mask. In Forbidden Colours (1951), an ageing writer manipulates a young gay man who has become engaged for convenience and financial security. In Temple of the Golden Pavilion (1956), an acolyte at the temple is transfixed by its beauty in the belief that it will be destroyed by the bombing raids – and when it survives the war, he takes it on himself to destroy it. And in Kyoko’s House (1959), a boxer takes up right-wing politics, while an actor becomes involved in a sado-masochistic sexual relationship that ends in a double suicide. Mishima’s subject matter was his own, but in style, at least, he was held to be a protegé of the Nobel-prize winner Yasunari Kawabata, who saw the function of literature as artistic, not propagandistic. Much of Mishima’s writing seems to cleave to this belief absolutely, with its formal, almost traditional style focusing on intensely sensual description above all else. Turned to bodies, clothes and scent, this selective depiction is almost fetishistic. “The shocking embrace of sheer nylon and the imitation damask of the couch gave the room a sense of agitation… The sharp hiss of the sash unwinding, like a serpent’s warning, was followed by a softer swishing sound as the kimono slipped to the floor.” (From The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea, 1963) But then something changed, and in the 60s the political phase of Mishima’s life might be said to begin. Having portrayed himself as a pure aesthete, a decadent romantic, in the last 10 years of his life Mishima underwent a transformation. It was then that he took up bodybuilding, working out in the gym for two hours a day to add muscle to his frail, 5ft-3in frame. He began bronzing himself in the sun, too, and set up a group of right-wing male university students that he led through workout routines. The stated purpose of this Shield Society was to assist the army in the event of a communist revolution. In his later years, Mishima took up bodybuilding to add bulk to his frail physique (Credit: Getty Images) Behind this transformation was a rationale which was, if not distilled, at least accumulated in Sun and Steel"" Art, Action and Ritual Death, an enigmatic essay published in 1968, two years before his death. Looking back, he saw that he had been corroded and weakened by an excess of fantasy and words, and a paucity of materiality and action. “In the average person, I imagine, the body precedes language,” Mishima writes. “In my case, words came first of all; then – belatedly, with every appearance of extreme reluctance, and already clothed in concepts – came the flesh. It was already, as goes without saying, sadly wasted by words.” He sought to rebalance himself and revived an old Samurai concept, the “harmony of pen and sword”. He longed to be seen as, to become, a “man of action”. A final burst of creativity Mishima was by now in his forties and acutely aware of his age. “The beautiful should die young, and everyone else should live as long as possible,” he wrote, in a piece on the early death of the actor James Dean. “Unfortunately, 95% of people get it backwards, with gorgeous people lingering into their eighties and hideous fools dropping dead at 21.” Mishima felt his moment was passing and began plotting his final act. Everyone, at some point, sees life as a stage. But few live and choreograph their lives as theatre, and fewer still would use seppuku to close out their performance. For Mishima, though, it was the culmination of a lifelong fantasy. The elements had been there from the very start, in Confessions of a Mask: soldiers, death and blood. The self-transformation into a warrior had made him into the object of his desire: something beautiful, something worth destroying. And the fixation on seppuku had grown in plain sight. Mishima even wrote and starred in a short film, Patriotism, in which he acted it out in detail. Perhaps Mishima’s final act was a political protest, too – but it was certainly death as art. On 25 November 1970, Mishima gave a speech to the army assembled below him, before taking his own life (Credit: Getty Images) On the morning of his last day, Mishima posted the final book of his tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility, to his publisher. These four books, written in a frantic burst of creativity, were something new. Starting in 1912, shortly after the Russo-Japanese War, and ending in 1975, they span a period of extraordinary change: from the ascendance of the Imperial Japan, through the annihilation of World War Two, and to the emergence of a capitalist, consumerist Japan. They are held together by one character, Honda – perhaps a stand-in for Mishima  – and the repeated reincarnation of his boyhood friend, an enduring soul surrounded by change and decline. Compared to Mishima’s early works, The Sea of Fertility contains much dense philosophising. And, after the second, the volumes feel rushed, becoming increasingly slim. Mishima wrote most of the final volume, The Decay of the Angel, during a seaside family holiday in August 1970. In a letter dated 18 November, 1970, to a mentor of his, Fumio Kiyomizu, Mishima wrote, “To me, finishing this [book] is nothing more than the end of the world.” The last lines of The Decay of the Angel are very still. “It was a bright, quiet garden, without striking features. Like a rosary rubbed between the hands, the shrilling of cicadas held sway. There was no other sound. The garden was empty. He had come, thought Honda, to a place that had no memories, nothing. The noontide sun of summer flowed over the still garden.”   If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

The new 'gold rush' for green lithium,,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201124-how-geothermal-lithium-could-revolutionise-green-energy,The new 'gold rush' for green lithium - BBC Future," Menu Cornwall, 1864. A hot spring is discovered nearly 450m (1,485ft) below ground in the Wheal Clifford, a copper mine just outside the mining town of Redruth. Glass bottles are immersed to their necks in its bubbling waters, carefully sealed and sent off for testing. The result is the discovery of so great a quantity of lithium – eight or 10 times as much per gallon as had been found in any hot spring previously analysed – that scientists suspect “it may prove of great commercial value”. But 19th-Century England had little need for the element, and this 122C (252F) lithium-rich water continued boiling away in the dark for more than 150 years. Fast forward to autumn 2020, and a site nearby the Wheal Clifford in Cornwall has been confirmed as having some of the world’s highest grades of lithium in geothermal waters. The commercial use for lithium in the 21st Century could not be clearer. It is found not only inside smart phones and laptops, but is now vital to the clean energy transition, for the batteries that power electric vehicles and store energy so renewable power can be released steadily and reliably. The lithium-rich waters running deep below the surface have been known about for well over a century – but they are only beginning to be tapped (Credit: Cornish Lithium) Demand has soared in recent years as carmakers move toward electric vehicles, as many countries including the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Canada announce a phase-out of combustion-engine cars. In fact, five times more lithium than is mined currently is going to be necessary to meet global climate targets by 2050, according to the World Bank. But there’s one big problem. Obtaining lithium by conventional means takes its own environmental toll, or rather three: carbon emissions, water and land. You might also like: Lithium is currently sourced mainly from hard rock mines, such as those in Australia, or underground brine reservoirs below the surface of dried lake beds, mostly in Chile and Argentina. Hard rock mining – where the mineral is extracted from open pit mines and then roasted using fossil fuels – leaves scars in the landscape, requires a large amount of water and releases 15 tonnes of CO2 for every tonne of lithium, according to an analysis of the whole lithium production process by raw materials experts Minviro. The other conventional option, extracting lithium from underground reservoirs, relies on even more water to extract the lithium – and it takes place in typically very water-scarce parts of the world, leading to indigenous communities questioning their sustainability. Extracting lithium from geothermal waters – found not just in Cornwall, but Germany and the US as well – has a tiny environmental footprint in comparison, including very low carbon emissions. One promise of geothermal mining is that the extraction process requires little to no fossil fuel consumption, and uses less land and water (Credit: Leonardo Soares/BBC) Geothermal brine is a hot, concentrated saline solution that has circulated through very hot rocks and become enriched with elements such as lithium, boron and potassium. In other words, the energy-intensive process of extracting lithium from solid rock is powered by naturally occurring geothermal energy. The brine in the Cornish mines has concentrations of up to 260 milligrams per litre, flowing at a rate of between 40-60 litres (8.1 to 13.7 gallons) per second. That works out as about enough lithium for a typical smartphone battery (2-3g) passing through the production process every few seconds, according to Cornish Lithium’s estimates. The demand for lithium with a lower environmental footprint appears to be gaining ground. There are signs car manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are starting to think about the environmental and social impact of their electric vehicle supply chain, says Alex Keynes, clean vehicles manager at Brussels-based campaign organisation Transport and Environment. Using lithium that is already in circulation – from recycled batteries and electronics – is preferable to mining more, says Keynes. “Given the enormous demand we’re likely to see over the coming years, [it] is going to mean we need some extraction, and recovering lithium from geothermal brine looks very promising,” says Keynes. The 1864 discovery of lithium might finally be about to bear fruit. Cornish Lithium, a company set up by former investment banker Jeremy Wrathall in 2016, is working on plans to extract potentially significant lithium resources from the brine in the region’s famous mines near Redruth. It has two main sites under development – one is at a deep geothermal plant, where it is collaborating with the energy developer Geothermal Engineering. The energy firm already plans to produce zero-carbon heat and power from the same hot water that contains the lithium, 5.2km (3.2 miles) underground at the United Downs Deep Geothermal Power Project. The water at this site also has low levels of sodium and magnesium compounds, which is a promising sign as these minerals make lithium extraction more difficult and expensive. In August, the project won £4m ($5.3m) backing from the UK government, allowing a pilot lithium extraction plant to be built in the next couple of years. Large quantities of lithium currently come from reservoirs in South America, but this method is water-intensive (Credit: Getty Images) The second geothermal lithium site sits next door to the United Downs project, and assessments of the potential for lithium extraction at a shallower depth of around 1km (0.6 miles) are underway. The company is also exploring the potential to extract lithium from granite rock in the China Clay region of Cornwall, near St Austell. The extraction of the lithium from Cornwall’s geothermal waters has been made possible by technological advances in both exploration and extraction, says Cornish Lithium’s senior geologist Lucy Crane. The team is using a variety of data sources to identify the most likely locations of the lithium. “Cornwall has an amazing mining heritage going back 4,500 years, which means there’s a hell of a lot of information out there about the sub-surface,” she says. Some of the historical maps are hand-painted on large pieces of vellum (animal skin used historically for writing). Cornish Lithium’s archivists take photos of it, and digitally stitch it together so that the geological information can be captured in 3D. That allows data from the 1860s, 1900s and 1960s to be combined and overlaid with modern information from satellites and drones. “This is a really powerful way of combining datasets, and allows you to efficiently target where you want to do on-the-ground exploration,” says Crane. “Then when we come to drilling, we’re as sure as we can be that we’re going to find something. That’s better from an economic point of view, but also minimises the environmental impact of the exploration process.” Lithium ion batteries are used to power electronic devices and store energy generated from wind and solar power, among their many other uses (Credit: Getty Images) Technological advances are also helping to make it possible to extract lithium from brine. The team is planning to use a technique called Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE), which has been developed by various companies in the US, Germany and New Zealand. There are as many as 60 variants of DLE technology, according to Jade Cove, a San Francisco-based advisory firm tracking new mining and energy technology. But the basic process involves using techniques such as nanofiltration or ion-exchange resins – which act like a chemical sieve to selectively collect just lithium chloride (the main form in which the lithium is found in the brine), leaving other salts in the water. The lithium chloride is retrieved from the sieve by, for example, washing the resin beads with pure water and injecting the remaining water back into the ground through boreholes. The lithium chloride is then purified and concentrated to produce lithium hydroxide, which is used to make batteries. But this is not the only way to get lithium from geothermal brine. In the US, William Stringfellow, director of the Ecological Engineering Research Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, is undertaking research for the US Department of Energy on the different methods for extracting lithium from brine. One approach is to extract lithium from brines using solvents designed to collect lithium ions, while others include the use of membranes that only allow lithium ions to pass, and electrochemical separation, where lithium ions are drawn to charged electrodes. “So DLE isn’t necessarily going to be the only technology, but it’s the first one that’s being applied,” says Stringfellow. Each method has one main stumbling block to navigate – getting only lithium out of the water. “There’s a lot of other materials in the brine that potentially interfere with the lithium extraction process [such as sodium and magnesium], so you have to control those and remove them,” says Stringfellow. The US and Germany are also hotbeds of research and development on geothermal lithium extraction. The area around the Salton Sea, a shallow lake in the centre of California and the second largest geothermal field in the US, has been dubbed “lithium valley”. The California Energy Commission has estimated that the field could provide 40% of global lithium demand. In research published in March this year, the commission forecast the region’s lithium carbonate supply at more than 600,000 tonnes a year, which could generate US$7.2bn (£5.3bn) a year at around US$12,000 (£8,885) a tonne. The hope is that lithium extraction could not only provide a cleaner, domestic source of lithium for batteries, but also significantly improve the economics of renewable power production from geothermal resources, which currently produce only 6% of California’s electricity and are expensive to develop. “Everyone has a lot of stars in their eyes, it’s like a new gold rush,” says Stringfellow. “It is an economically depressed area, so people are very excited about the fact that if they get lithium going, it would lead to an economic boom.” Large-scale renewable generation also requires large-scale power storage if energy is to be supplied steadily (Credit: Getty Images) There is a similar anticipation in Germany, where the Rhine Valley is the centre of the country’s nascent geothermal lithium industry. Lithium and geothermal power developer Vulcan Energy Resources plans to pump hot geothermal brine to the surface, and use the heat to power its lithium extraction process, and feed excess back into the grid. In November, Vulcan Energy Resources announced that its main site had significant reserves, with lithium concentrations of 181 milligrams per litre. It will carry out a full feasibility study in 2021, with the aim of scaling up to full commercial production of lithium in 2023-24. “We have a resource which is large enough to satisfy a very substantial amounts of the demand in the European markets here for many, many years to come,” Vulcan’s chief executive Francis Wedin told an industry conference in October. The Rhine Valley is located in the heart of Germany’s car manufacturing region, a location that would give a lithium plant business advantages in supplying electric vehicle makers. But it also significantly reduces the carbon emissions associated with transporting lithium from overseas, Wedin noted. As a result, the firm plans to market its lithium as “zero carbon”. Back in Cornwall, zero carbon is also the goal for Cornish Lithium’s production process, which it envisions will be powered by geothermal heat. And if its pilot project proves successful, Cornish Lithium is confident that plants could be developed across the region. “All the clean technologies that we need to combat climate change – whether that’s wind turbines, solar panels or batteries, they’re all really, really mineral intensive,” says Crane. “We need to make sure we extract these materials as responsibly as possible otherwise it mitigates the reason for building these technologies in the first place.” In all, it may still be a few years before batteries made using zero-carbon lithium are powering your car, or other devices. But if zero-carbon lithium takes off in the way its champions hope, it could become a powerful example of a mineral essential for sustainable energy, obtained in a sustainable way. -- The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2.

'Every date becomes more precious now',,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201116-how-the-pandemic-has-changed-our-romantic-relationships,Coronavirus: Why dating feels so different now - BBC Worklife," Menu Emily, a 29-year-old surveyor from London, says she’s always been something of an introvert. She’d dabbled in dating, but when the UK’s first lockdown restrictions ended in July, she was reluctant to begin dating in person again. “I’d chatted with some people on dating apps, but I wasn’t in a rush to meet up with anyone,” she says. “Everything about the pandemic had made me quite anxious.” In early August, she agreed to meet someone from a dating app for a drink, her first date since March. “We’d been exchanging messages for a few months, and he was really nice,” says Emily, who did not want her full name used. But when they did finally meet, she says, ""I just felt extremely hesitant"". “In the back of my mind, I still wasn’t sure I was ready to date again. Later that day I sent him a text explaining how I felt, and he replied saying he had sensed that from my body language.”     Emily isn’t alone in feeling like dating amid Covid-19 is fraught. In fact, her behaviour chimes with a 2017 study in which a group of psychologists at Montréal’s McGill University looked into whether people’s dating behaviour would change if they were worried about the risk of infectious disease. Would people shy away from chasing romance if they were subconsciously aware of a potential health risk, or would the natural human desire to find a partner prevail? The researchers had little idea that Covid-19 was around the corner. Now, their work, combined with other psychological studies conducted during the pandemic, offers a fascinating and highly relevant window into how the crisis appears to be affecting our dating behaviour. And, it points to ways in which we can date more effectively in the future as well as form deeper and stronger relationship bonds. Some may prefer to keep their distance from potential partners if they perceive a health threat (Credit: Alamy) The McGill experiment suggests Emily’s avoidance might be down to an element of our psyche known as the “behavioural immune system”. Pathogens have presented a threat to our survival throughout human history. So, evolutionary psychologists believe humans have evolved a set of subconscious responses that manifest when we are particularly concerned about the presence of an infectious disease. These responses lead us to engage in behavioural patterns that reduce the likelihood of getting infected, such as being less open and making reduced eye contact when in social situations. The McGill team examined how this played out in a dating context. They took several hundred heterosexual male and female singletons, aged 18 to 35, and had them complete a known psychometric test known as PVDS, or the perceived vulnerability to disease scale. This consists of a 15-item questionnaire, asking participants to rate from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) their feelings on questions such as, ‘It really bothers me when people sneeze without covering their mouths’, or ‘My immune system protects me from most illnesses that other people get’. Each of the participants then watched a video about hygiene and the abundance of bacteria in the everyday world. This was intended to prime their behavioural immune system before they went on an evening’s speed dating with members of the opposite sex. Intriguingly, the researchers found that those who had indicated they felt more vulnerable to disease consistently displayed much lower levels of interest in their prospective dates. This was true even when they were highly attractive. Fear of disease made them less interested in romancing. As in Emily’s case, the speed-dating partners in the study found their date’s subdued behaviour noticeable, a finding that struck John Lydon, one of the authors of the study, as “especially remarkable”. “Within just a few minutes, people found that dates who had a high perceived vulnerability to disease, although of course they did not know this, to be more withdrawn and less friendly,” he says. May people who are more concerned about vulnerability to disease change their dating behaviour as a self-protection mechanism (Credit: Alamy) Of course, even if you could ignore survival messages from your subconscious, simply meeting a potential partner has not been easy during the pandemic. National lockdowns have seen individual freedoms curtailed in an unprecedented manner for months at a time, making it almost impossible to get out and date. But as work has moved online, so has romance. Ben, a 27-year-old actuary living in Bristol, was initially sceptical about the idea of video dates. But with few alternatives in early April, he soon began to embrace this new dating trend, and even find some advantages of it. “One of the main problems with dating apps is that you have no idea what the other person is really like before you meet them,” says Ben, who asked to withhold his full name in case potential future dates found it while searching him. “There’s nothing more awkward than meeting someone in a bar, and finding within the first five minutes that you have no chemistry. With video dates, it’s a bit more relaxed. You can have a chat and a drink from your own homes, and if you don’t get along, you don’t feel like you’ve wasted an evening.” Behavioural scientist Logan Ury, who currently works as director of relationship science at dating app Hinge, has also noticed a change in how people are approaching online dating. Pre-pandemic it was common for people to use the app to continually move from person to person. But as social restrictions came in, people have began spending longer getting to know each other in the virtual world before meeting. This has meant that when they did finally get to meet in person, the encounter carried more importance in their minds. “The pandemic has meant that every date becomes more precious,” says Ury. “I’ve seen people enter into relationships for the first time in a long while, because they had fewer distractions, and the person they were dating became more valuable to them. “Those people had broken a habit of always moving onto the next one, viewing the grass as always being greener on the other side, and that change probably would not have happened without the pandemic.”   She believes people have also become clearer with themselves and others as to what they’re looking for, due to the introspection which many people have undergone during lockdowns. “Because people have spent a lot of time alone, thinking when’s the next Covid spike going to be, when’s the next lockdown, it’s led to people dating in a more intentional way. And that intentionality can show up in a number of ways. For example, being more clear with yourself and others about what you want, valuing each date and really preparing for it mentally and not ghosting if you’re not interested. In general, I think these are things which are really good for the dating community.”    Although video dates may feel a bit unnatural, there may be positive knock-on effects from our shift to dating on our screens (Credit: Alamy) People who have already settled down are not immune to the pandemic’s romance impact, however. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, social psychologist Paula Pietromonaco has been examining what makes some couples bond more even more despite the stresses of the crisis, while others are pushed apart. While socioeconomic factors do play a critical, with couples more financially affected by the pandemic more likely to split up, Pietromonaco says that a lot comes down to how couples approach problems that come their way. “If they see themselves as a team, blaming the stress on the pandemic itself, rather than something about their partner, they are most likely to emerge through the situation stronger,” she says. Because the pandemic has been so life-changing for everyone, she predicts that the long-term prospects of many couples will be influenced by the patterns of behaviour established during this period. “Behaviours are likely to carry over after the pandemic,” she says. “Couples may end up being better at communicating, better at supporting each other after this is over. But if they get into patterns of conflict, that also can spiral. For some, it could be enough of a shake-up that it helps them change their behaviour for the better, while for others it could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.” For some singles, the pandemic may have brought changes that are here to stay even as life returns to normal. “I think video calls are very much here to stay as a means of pre-screening people you meet on the apps,” says Ben. “Once the first lockdown ended, I still preferred initially getting to know people in the virtual world before we went for drinks. I feel it’s definitely a positive trend. I’m now going on fewer dates, but when I do, it tends to be far more likely that the date goes well.” "
