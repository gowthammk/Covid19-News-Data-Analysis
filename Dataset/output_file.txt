How a vaccine might be approved

There are three ways the public might get access to a vaccine. At an advisory panel meeting a few weeks ago, the FDA discussed all three. (While the CDC oversees the response to disease outbreaks, the FDA is responsible for approving drugs and vaccines.)

Full approval

First, there is the usual pathway a vaccine would go through: approval of a biologics license application, or BLA. The FDA has approved plenty of vaccines in its time, and guidelines for the process can be found here. Besides data from all three phases of clinical trials, the FDA also wants to inspect the facility that manufactures the vaccine.

The FDA also typically requires “phase 4” studies after the vaccine is approved, to obtain more information about safety and efficacy than what was known at the time of approval. These studies help to figure out whether there might be long-term side effects, or whether protection fades over time.

The FDA has laid out the specifics on what it’s looking for in a COVID-19 vaccine application in this document.

Whichever vaccine we get, it will probably go through this process sooner or later. But time is critical: the sooner we get a safe and effective vaccine, the more lives we can save. So regulators are considering two other pathways that could make the vaccine available sooner.

Emergency use authorization (EUA)

An EUA is sort of like a temporary approval, and can be given with just a fraction of the extensive red tape required for a full approval. It can also be rescinded if further research shows that the risks or harms outweigh benefits. For example, the FDA issued an EUA for hydroxychloroquine earlier in the pandemic, and then revoked it when the drug turned out not to be effective in widespread use. (Hydroxychloroquine was already approved, but the EUA allowed the drug to be deployed from the national stockpile for COVID-19 patients.)

The FDA released guidelines for vaccine manufacturers with their criteria for granting an EUA. Like the document mentioned above about approval, this represents the agency’s “current thinking” about what they’re looking for, but leaves room for them to change their mind as new information comes in.

Importantly, the FDA expects vaccine manufacturers to keep working toward full approval even if they get an EUA, and to continue any trials that are in progress. That raises an ethical issue, since potentially half the subjects in phase 3 trials have only gotten a placebo, not the actual vaccine. Should they be told they got the placebo, and allowed to get the newly-authorized vaccine? Or should they remain enrolled, so as to keep collecting placebo-controlled safety and efficacy data? In an FDA advisory committee meeting a few weeks ago, the panelists didn’t seem to come to a consensus on the best way to handle this dilemma.

Expanded access

Instead of a full or temporary approval, there’s another pathway to make drugs available: expanded access, sometimes called compassionate use. This is typically used when a patient is very sick, the treatment in question is not otherwise available, and there is no way to enroll them in a clinical trial. The potential benefits of the treatment still have to outweigh the potential risks.

It’s not clear if the FDA would consider a COVID-19 vaccine an appropriate candidate for expanded use, since it’s given to healthy people for prevention and not people with life threatening illnesses as a last resort.

But some ethicists are arguing that expanded access is appropriate because it would allow a small number of people who are at high risk to start receiving the vaccine, while placebo-controlled trials continue.

How the FDA will define ‘safe’ and ‘effective’

Regulators are already concerned that they are losing the public’s trust, especially now that the p resident has used the possibility of a vaccine as a political football—remember the orders to get vaccine sites ready by November 1, just before the election?

During that FDA meeting I mentioned, speaker after speaker expressed fears that even the name “Operation Warp Speed” might make people think that vaccine development is being rushed. They talked about balancing the need for a timely vaccine with the optics of rolling something out before it’s fully tested.

Trust isn’t just an issue from a vanity perspective—honestly, who cares if the FDA’s feelings are hurt? What’s important is that if people think a vaccine isn’t trustworthy, they won’t want to get it. And what good is a vaccine that nobody takes?

Fortunately, as I listened, I was reassured that there will be a decent amount of safety and efficacy data available before the vaccine is rolled out. According to the FDA, their requirements for an EUA will be similar to those for full approval. The difference will be in things like paperwork and factory inspections, not safety data.

The critical numbers, for either approval or an EUA, are these:

The vaccine’s effectiveness, as measured in a placebo-controlled trial, must be at least 50%.

Participants in the trial must have been followed for at least two months after vaccination, on average, to gather safety data.

For comparison, many childhood vaccines, like those for measles, have an efficacy of more than 90%. The flu shot ranges from 30% to 60% effective depending on the year. Preliminary results from Pfizer’s COVID vaccine trial appear to show that it’s 90% effective, which would be amazing if it holds true as more data comes in. (The nerd in me needs to insert a note here saying that efficacy and effectiveness are not exactly the same, but you get the idea.)

How we’ll find out if there are safety issues that occur after a vaccine becomes available

If the FDA only requires two months’ follow-up at the time of an EUA or approval, then there is no way to know whether the vaccines’ protection wanes over the course of many months or years. There is also no way to know if “adverse events,” or serious side effects, might occur further down the road.

Regulators are currently planning multiple ways of monitoring vaccine recipients for safety issues. First, the vaccine manufacturers will probably still be following up their study participants, and possibly enrolling people in further studies.

Second, there is already a system called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. Anyone can file a report if they think they were harmed by a vaccine. This is one way regulators and manufacturers can get an early heads-up that an issue might be popping up, even if it is uncommon and didn’t show up in trials. (Regulators sometimes refer to VAERS as a “hypothesis generating system” since the reports in it aren’t necessarily verified. In other words, they’re not proof that something is going on, but they can be a start in figuring that out.)

Next, there is a system called the Vaccine Data Link, which the CDC runs as a partnership with healthcare organizations. This data doesn’t cover as many people as VAERS, but it can be more reliable and it can also be updated very quickly in what the agency calls “rapid cycle analysis.” Like VAERS, this system has been used for other vaccines, including the HPV and flu vaccines.

The CDC is also planning a system called V-SAFE, which will involve reaching out to people who received the vaccine to ask, proactively, about how they are feeling. The first groups of people to receive the vaccine—up to about 20 million people—will get a daily text asking about symptoms during the first week, and then weekly texts until the six-week mark.

There are more plans, which you can read about here on the CDC website. Regulators are planning to comb through these data sources for the symptoms and complications they think are most likely to be of concern, collect further data about what is going on, and keep a close eye on whether the vaccine still meets safety and efficacy criteria.

Even with all of these precautions, there are a lot of unknowns, and i t’s entirely possible this whole process will be going on with four different vaccines at the same time, too. Whether the vaccine is seen as safe will depend on how everything plays out, but it’s good to know that the FDA and other government agencies are taking the safety considerations seriously.How Will the Government Approve a Vaccine?Vaccine development is proceeding at record speed, with one candidate announcing early results from a U.S. phase 3 trial this week and likely more to come.

Trump scores a long-awaited coronavirus win with vaccines on the wayPresident Donald Trump finally has something legitimate to take credit for in his coronavirus response: A vaccine that appears poised to reach Americans in record time.(CNN) President Donald Trump finally has something legitimate to take credit for in his coronavirus response: A vaccine that appears poised to reach Americans in record time.

The federal government poured billions into developing and manufacturing vaccine candidates in the hopes they would prove safe and effective. The pricey gamble appears to be paying off, with a vaccine on track to reach some Americans by the end of the year -- the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed.

"Should the administration be praised for this? Absolutely," said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a sharp critic of the administration's coronavirus response. "Donald Trump probably doesn't know the difference between a white cell and a prison cell, but the administration got this right."

Health experts broadly agree that the Trump administration's national vaccine strategy was a success. The Trump administration was willing to invest in new vaccine technologies, foot the bill for large, expensive clinical studies and simultaneously pay for manufacturing vaccine candidates before it was clear they would prove effective and safe.

Trump held out the promise of a vaccine as part of his reelection strategy, but his very public bluster appears to have done very little to influence the actual process. His real impact was in the government's investment, experts said.

Trump cheered the latest vaccine news on Twitter Monday, in the wake of Moderna joining Pfizer's ranks in reporting stunning efficacy numbers for their vaccine candidates. Experts now believe the first coronavirus vaccines could become available to frontline medical workers as early as December.

"For those great 'historians', please remember that these great discoveries ... all took place on my watch!" Trump tweeted.

White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern applauded Trump's work, and took a swipe at Democrats.

The President "not only sped up the bureaucratic process, he also developed and implemented an innovative strategy to manufacture doses in advance of approval," Morgenstern said. "Vice President Biden, Senator Harris, and other leading Democrats have been playing politics with peoples' lives by sowing doubts about the vaccines, and now blame those doubts on the very leader who is bringing the vaccines into existence, which is truly unconscionable."

Early investments

As the first conversations with federal health officials got underway early this year, several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies made clear that they would need massive investments from the federal government in order to develop and manufacture a coronavirus vaccine at scale.

"The companies were willing to do it, but they made it clear there was no way they were going to do it without the investment of hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars," the senior federal health official said.

The investment would not only allow the companies to more rapidly develop and manufacture potential vaccines, but it would critically assuage the financial risk that corporate boards would be concerned about.

"I can't tell you where we would be if we didn't have Operation Warp Speed, but I can say it's unlikely we would be where we are right now," the official said.

Some of the technology behind the upcoming vaccines has been in the works for years.

"Some of the speed had to do with the fact that actually, the scientific work, which led up to the development of these vaccines has been going on for 15 years," said Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the CDC and an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University, who nonetheless agreed that the administration deserved credit for the speed at which the vaccines were developed.

Rick Bright -- a former Trump administration health official and current member of President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus transition team -- said Obama administration investments in messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology helped propel coronavirus vaccine development this year.

The Obama administration invested in the technology "so, when we needed them now for this crisis they were ready to run," Bright said on ABC's "Good Morning America" Tuesday. "So, I'm really encouraged that the Obama investment in these new technologies is paying out now, so we can have them ready faster than we've ever seen."

The mRNA technology has never been used in an approved vaccine before and is designed to produce an immune response in people who have been inoculated.

The senior federal health official acknowledged that the development of the mRNA platform helped dramatically speed the vaccine development timeline but added the massive financial injection from the federal government likely helped speed up research and development. And even more critically, the investment in manufacturing tens of millions of vaccine doses before clinical trials were completed will speed the roll out.

Experts outside the government agreed.

"They made the big gamble. They were willing to throw away hundreds of millions of doses if the vaccine were not safe or effective," Offit said of the Trump administration. "When we look back on this historically, we will see this as a year when a remarkable amount was achieved in a short period of time."

Presidential pressure

Trump, however, committed a cardinal sin by injecting politics into the vaccine process.

He openly clamored for a vaccine in time to bolster his ill-fated reelection bid, igniting fear among some in the medical community and the American public. Privately and publicly, Trump called on vaccine makers to speed up their development timelines and even suggested he may try to intervene to speed up the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine authorization process.

"The national politicians have been very much out front in this and have really created a very substantial political veneer over the entire vaccine development process," Schaffner said. "That has had an effect of creating a terrific amount of skepticism."

At one point, vaccine makers were apparently so concerned about the perception the President was creating that they released a joint letter vowing to move forward with their vaccine candidates under "high ethical standards and sound scientific principles."

Schaffner said that message appeared to be aimed squarely at the White House to say: "Sit down and shut up and let us take care of this."

One official familiar with the calls between Trump and the vaccine makers conceded they did not believe his pressure prompted anyone to work faster. The situation was already urgent.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of Operation Warp Speed, affirmed as much in a Monday MSNBC interview.

"The President has never been very actively involved," Slaoui, said. "As I said many times, we have had no interference one way or the other. And we have informed him from time to time."

The official familiar with Trump's calls to vaccine makers said the executives took the President's calls and attended meetings at the White House because they recognized it was important for them to appear a part of the effort. They tended to give Trump an optimistic outlook when they spoke to him in order to avoid him lashing out.

They didn't always avoid Trump's temper.

When Pfizer announced -- six days after Election Day -- that its vaccine appeared more than 90% effective in clinical trial data, Trump unleashed on Twitter.

"As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn't have the courage to do it before," Trump tweeted.

The furious President also called FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, demanding to know why the information wasn't made public before the election and accusing Pfizer of trying to undermine him, according to a White House official.

FDA and HHS spokespeople declined to comment.

Pfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla dismissed the notion that the company had been holding back results.

"We announced it the moment we learned about it, and I said multiple times the election for us is an artificial timeline," Bourla said. "This is when science brought it to us."

In a Tuesday interview with The New York Times , Bourla added: "I knew very well, because I had spoken to the President, that he would like to see it earlier, but I didn't receive any pressure, per se, on me to do something that is not appropriate."

Trump has kept up his griping, publicly scolding Pfizer for pointing out that the company didn't receive funds to develop its vaccine through Operation Warp Speed. It did, however, ink a nearly $2 billion deal for the federal government to purchase millions of doses of its vaccine.

"We have made an unwavering commitment to ensure that our vaccine is both safe and effective before it is made available to the general public," said Sharon Castillo, a Pfizer spokeswoman. "In doing so, we have shared the sense of urgency and the drive to find health care solutions to this pandemic that have been the engine behind Operation Warp Speed. We appreciate the assistance that OWS is providing to ensure the vaccine is distributed to priority populations like health care workers and the vulnerable."

A tricky transition

The next big test for the federal government will be getting shots into Americans' arms. It's a complicated task already made more difficult by Trump's refusal to concede and allow the presidential transition process to begin.

"More people may die if we don't coordinate," Biden said Monday. "How do we get over 300 million Americans vaccinated? What's the game plan? It's a huge, huge, huge undertaking to get it done."

Health officials including Operation Warp Speed's Slaoui and the National Institute of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci have both said that making contact with Biden's transition team could help limit any disruption to vaccine distribution plans. So far, they are not allowed to do so.

"Transitions are important, and if you don't have a smooth transition, you would not optimize whatever efforts you're doing right now," Fauci said on CNN Tuesday, likening it to a relay race where "you're passing the baton and you don't want to slow down what you're doing."

Those concerns from public health experts inside and outside the administration appear to have had little impact on the President.

He spent the day tweeting about the election results.Trump scores a long-awaited coronavirus win with vaccines on the wayPresident Donald Trump finally has something legitimate to take credit for in his coronavirus response: A vaccine that appears poised to reach Americans in record time.(CNN) President Donald Trump finally has something legitimate to take credit for in his coronavirus response: A vaccine that appears poised to reach Americans in record time.

Schaffner said that message appeared to be aimed squarely at the White House to say: "Sit down and shut up and let us take care of this."

One official familiar with the calls between Trump and the vaccine makers conceded they did not believe his pressure prompted anyone to work faster. The situation was already urgent.

Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of Operation Warp Speed, affirmed as much in a Monday MSNBC interview.

"The President has never been very actively involved," Slaoui, said. "As I said many times, we have had no interference one way or the other. And we have informed him from time to time."

The official familiar with Trump's calls to vaccine makers said the executives took the President's calls and attended meetings at the White House because they recognized it was important for them to appear a part of the effort. They tended to give Trump an optimistic outlook when they spoke to him in order to avoid him lashing out.

They didn't always avoid Trump's temper.

When Pfizer announced -- six days after Election Day -- that its vaccine appeared more than 90% effective in clinical trial data, Trump unleashed on Twitter.

"As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn't have the courage to do it before," Trump tweeted.

The furious President also called FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, demanding to know why the information wasn't made public before the election and accusing Pfizer of trying to undermine him, according to a White House official.

FDA and HHS spokespeople declined to comment.

Pfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla dismissed the notion that the company had been holding back results.

"We announced it the moment we learned about it, and I said multiple times the election for us is an artificial timeline," Bourla said. "This is when science brought it to us."

In a Tuesday interview with The New York Times , Bourla added: "I knew very well, because I had spoken to the President, that he would like to see it earlier, but I didn't receive any pressure, per se, on me to do something that is not appropriate."

Trump has kept up his griping, publicly scolding Pfizer for pointing out that the company didn't receive funds to develop its vaccine through Operation Warp Speed. It did, however, ink a nearly $2 billion deal for the federal government to purchase millions of doses of its vaccine.

"We have made an unwavering commitment to ensure that our vaccine is both safe and effective before it is made available to the general public," said Sharon Castillo, a Pfizer spokeswoman. "In doing so, we have shared the sense of urgency and the drive to find health care solutions to this pandemic that have been the engine behind Operation Warp Speed. We appreciate the assistance that OWS is providing to ensure the vaccine is distributed to priority populations like health care workers and the vulnerable."

A tricky transition

The next big test for the federal government will be getting shots into Americans' arms. It's a complicated task already made more difficult by Trump's refusal to concede and allow the presidential transition process to begin.

"More people may die if we don't coordinate," Biden said Monday. "How do we get over 300 million Americans vaccinated? What's the game plan? It's a huge, huge, huge undertaking to get it done."

Health officials including Operation Warp Speed's Slaoui and the National Institute of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci have both said that making contact with Biden's transition team could help limit any disruption to vaccine distribution plans. So far, they are not allowed to do so.

"Transitions are important, and if you don't have a smooth transition, you would not optimize whatever efforts you're doing right now," Fauci said on CNN Tuesday, likening it to a relay race where "you're passing the baton and you don't want to slow down what you're doing."

Those concerns from public health experts inside and outside the administration appear to have had little impact on the President.

He spent the day tweeting about the election results.

The massive pharmaceutical company and its partner, BioNTech, announced its vaccine was 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 cases, which far surpassed expectations of a perhaps 60-70 percent effective vaccine. That is unequivocal great news and portends good things for other vaccines further behind in the developmental process.

Trump allies were quick to take credit for the breakthrough, despite the fact the Pfizer did not take any research and development funding from Operation Warp Speed, the administration's effort to speed up a vaccine's arrival.

"We were never part of the Warp Speed," Kathrin Jansen, a senior vice president and the head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer told the New York Times. "We have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone."

Vice President Mike Pence, Ivanka Trump, and others, however, were quick to lavish praise on outgoing President Donald Trump, who lost the 2020 election to President-elect Joe Biden.

HUGE NEWS: Thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President @realDonaldTrump, @pfizer announced its Coronavirus Vaccine trial is EFFECTIVE, preventing infection in 90% of its volunteers. — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) November 9, 2020

To be fair to Ivanka Trump, there is a bit of truth in her tweet. Pfizer did strike a deal with the government to help distribute the vaccine, pending its effectiveness. The government put in an initial order for 100 million doses for $1.95 billion "following FDA authorization or approval." But unlike its competitors, Pfizer did not take government cash to help fund its development process.

So, in classic Trump administration fashion, there was some truthiness to their claims of massive success. Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy — a regular, vocal critic of Trump — noted that while the outgoing president shouldn't take credit for the vaccine, this was a public-private partnership.

"The Pfizer vaccine requires a complicated and expensive distribution process, so with lots of other vaccine candidates, $2B in taxpayer money to pay for the distribution is a big leg up," he wrote on Twitter. "Again, not saying Trump should take credit, but the government [dollars] matter here."

AstraZeneca and Oxford University Say Their Vaccine Is ‘Highly Effective’The coronavirus vaccine candidate was up to 90 percent effective, said the drugmaker, which became the third this month to report promising results.

At the same time, the virus is accelerating across the U.S., and officials are imposing new restrictions to flatten the curve. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s not just the Midwest: The U.S. outbreak is accelerating all over the map. A drive-through testing site in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times When infections began rising sharply in the U.S. in September, the growth was driven largely by outbreaks in the Upper Midwest. States like North Dakota and Wisconsin soon became the hardest hit in the nation, relative to their size, and the region continues to struggle. Now, though, with the whole country’s daily average of new cases is as high as it has ever been — over 171,000 — the most rapid growth is happening elsewhere. Nine states are reporting more than twice as many new cases a day as they did two weeks ago, and none of them are in the Midwest. The surges in those states — Arizona, California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Vermont — reflect a still-escalating national crisis. Officials warn that it will only get worse if people disregard warnings about travel and get-togethers for the approaching holidays. “Let me be very clear: A Thanksgiving gathering this year may very well lead to a funeral,” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, whose state is home to five of the 10 metropolitan areas in the country where new case reports are rising the fastest. “The virus is at large,” the governor said. “Know the risks and respect them.” Forty-five states are seeing sustained increases, and 17 states added more cases in the seven-day period that ended Sunday than in any other week of the pandemic. Major metropolitan areas that are reporting new cases at or near record levels are all across the continent: Pittsburgh. Albuquerque. Baltimore. San Diego. Some that have been bad for a while, like El Paso, are coping with the flood of hospitalizations that generally follow a couple of weeks behind a rising tide of new cases. A major hospital group in Arizona, Banner Health, began banning most visitors from its facilities Sunday night because of the worsening spread of the virus.



And where the hospitals come under intense strain, officials are turning, however reluctantly, to impose or reimpose restrictions in the hope of flattening the curve. In Los Angeles County, Calif., which has been averaging more than 3,500 cases a day lately, officials said on Sunday that barring indoor restaurant dining was no longer sufficient, and that outdoor dining would have to shut down as well. “Unfortunately, if our cases and hospitalizations continue to increase, we will need to issue further restrictions to protect our health care system and prevent more deaths,” said Barbara Ferrer, the county public health director. —

AstraZeneca becomes the third major vaccine developer to announce promising results. A volunteer in Oxford, England, last week received the vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times The drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that an early analysis of some of its late-stage clinical trials, conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, showed that its coronavirus vaccine was 70.4 percent effective in preventing Covid-19, suggesting that the world could eventually have at least three working vaccines — and more supply — to help curb the pandemic. The British-Swedish company, which has been developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the third major vaccine developer this month to announce encouraging early results, following Pfizer and Moderna, which both said that their vaccines were about 95 percent effective in late-stage studies. AstraZeneca’s results are a reassuring sign of the safety of the vaccine. It came under global scrutiny after AstraZeneca temporarily paused its trials in September to investigate potential safety issues after a participant in Britain developed a neurological illness. Oxford and AstraZeneca said they would submit their data to regulators in Britain, Europe and Brazil and seek emergency authorization. The company said its early analysis was based on 131 coronavirus cases. The trials used two different dosing regimens, one of which was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 and the other of which was 62 percent effective. The regimen that was 90 percent effective involved using a halved first dose and a standard second dose. Oxford and AstraZeneca also said that there were no hospitalized or severe cases of the coronavirus in anyone who received the vaccine, and that they had seen a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine could reduce transmission. AstraZeneca’s vaccine is expected to come with relatively simple storage requirements, which would be an asset once it gets rolled out. The company has said it anticipates the vaccine will require refrigeration, though it has not provided details about how long and at what temperature it can be kept. Moderna’s vaccine can be kept for up to a month at the temperature of an ordinary refrigerator. Pfizer’s can be kept for up to 5 days in conventional refrigerators, or in special coolers for up to 15 days, but otherwise needs ultracold storage. AstraZeneca has said it aims to bring data from its studies of its vaccine being conducted overseas to the Food and Drug Administration — which would mean that the agency will likely review and authorize a vaccine before late-stage data are ready on how well the vaccine works in American participants. British regulators already have been conducting a so-called rolling review of the vaccine. “Today marks an important milestone in our fight against the pandemic,” AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said. “This vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against Covid-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency.” Professor Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said that “these findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives.” AstraZeneca’s results could significantly strengthen the global effort to produce enough vaccine to create population immunity: The price of the shot, at $3 to $4, is a fraction of that of some other potential vaccines, and AstraZeneca has pledged to make it available at cost around the world until at least July 2021 and in poorer countries in perpetuity. — Rebecca Robbins, Benjamin Mueller and

Cuomo announces new restrictions in Upper Manhattan, Staten Island and other hot spots. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:43 - 0:00 transcript Cuomo Announces New Virus Restrictions Ahead of Thanksgiving Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. We are now coming into the high social season — Thanksgiving, Christmas. It’s the high social season, social activity goes way up in this season. That is a bad combination. Just factor out the current rate of increase. You know, where we are in three weeks? Six thousand cases. That’s before we go into 37 days of the highest socialization period of the year. Yellow Zone in New York City is 2.5, reduces house of worship gatherings. Orange Zone reduces mass gatherings, more businesses close; high risk in an Orange Zone, schools close to clean and test, and then can reopen if they test and the positivity rate is low. New York City, Upper Manhattan is going to become a Yellow Zone. Basically, the Washington Heights area is 3.3. Staten Island, part is a Yellow Zone, part is an Orange Zone. Staten Island is a problem. The number of hospitalizations in Staten Island have gone — over the last three weeks — they basically tripled 33 to 91. It’s a consequence of action. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. Credit Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times As Thanksgiving approaches, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Monday announced new restrictions in parts of the state where virus cases are rising, including New York City, and issued a grim warning that the state was on track for a further resurgence of the virus. The new restrictions included a zone in Upper Manhattan, the first time the state has rolled back reopening in the borough under its program of targeting so-called microclusters. “These are dangerous times that we’re in,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in New York City. Over the last three weeks, the number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state has more than doubled, to 2,724 on Monday from 1,227 on Nov. 2. The number is a far cry from the peak of the pandemic in the spring, when more than 18,000 people were hospitalized. But Mr. Cuomo warned that if current patterns held, the state would hit 6,000 hospitalizations in another three weeks. The increase could become steeper, he said, if people continued gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas in the coming weeks, which he called “37 days of the highest socialization of the year.” The governor again warned residents not to travel for the holidays. The state has currently imposed a 10-person limit on private gatherings in hopes of limiting small parties that he has said have contributed to the resurgence of the virus in the state this fall. Parts of Upper Manhattan, including Washington Heights, will now be a yellow zone under the state’s tiered, color-coded restriction system. Gatherings will be limited to 25 people, with houses of worship limited to 50 percent capacity. Restaurants can serve only up to 4 people at a table. Mr. Cuomo also announced an orange zone, the second level of limits, in southern parts of Staten Island. In those areas, indoor dining will close, as will some nonessential businesses deemed to be high risk, such as gyms and personal-care services. All gatherings will be limited to 10 people, with houses of worship limited to 33 percent capacity and 25 people maximum. Other parts of the borough will become a yellow zone. “Staten Island is a problem,” Mr. Cuomo said. The borough has been a hot spot for the virus in the city in recent months. Mr. Cuomo said that hospitalizations there had increased enough that Staten Island was facing a capacity issue. As a result, the state will open an emergency coronavirus patient facility in the South Beach neighborhood, a move reminiscent of field hospitals set up in the spring, when New York City was one of the hardest hit places in the country. The state also announced new yellow zones in parts of Long Island, including Great Neck, Riverhead and Hampton Bays, and expanded yellow and orange zones upstate, around the cities of Rochester and Syracuse. —

Boris Johnson will lift restrictions on many businesses in England beginning next week. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript England Will Lift Coronavirus Restrictions The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. The national restrictions in England will end on the 2nd of December, and they will not be renewed. From next Wednesday, people will be able to leave their home for any purpose, and meet others in outdoor public spaces subject to the Rule of 6. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen. But without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a winter or new-year surge. The incidence of the disease is, alas, still widespread in many areas. So we’re not going to replace national measures with a free for all — the status quo ante-Covid — we’re going to go back instead to a regional tiered approach, applying the toughest measures where Covid is most prevalent. I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year. But in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. We all want some kind of Christmas. We need it. We certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. Credit Credit... Tolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Gyms, stores and hair salons will be allowed to reopen in England next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday, telling lawmakers that for the first time since the spread of the coronavirus the country could “see a route out of the pandemic.” Speaking to Parliament by video link, Mr. Johnson said that he would lift a national lockdown on Dec. 2, as expected, and that England would then return to a regionalized system of restrictions based on three tiers of controls. However, the new plan will keep substantial restrictions on pubs and restaurants — a move that risks friction with some of Mr. Johnson’s own lawmakers, who fear that the hospitality trade will be hit hard by the limitations. Crucially, the government has not yet announced which parts of the country will be subjected to which set of restrictions, though that information is expected later this week. Mr. Johnson, who has been quarantining since last week after being exposed to a member of Parliament who tested positive, hailed the progress announced by the team at Oxford University developing a vaccine with the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, adding that the “scientific cavalry is in sight.” There have been at least 1.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to Public Health England. As of Monday morning, 55,024 people had died. United Kingdom Covid Map and Case Count A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. Under the plan to ease restrictions, gyms, stores and hair salons will reopen and collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports will be allowed to resume in all parts of England. But in the worst-affected parts of the country, pubs and restaurants will stay closed except for takeout service. In some other areas, people will only be able to drink in pubs if they are also eating a meal. Those pubs will, however, be allowed to stay open until 11 p.m., an hour later than had been allowed immediately before the lockdown began, though the bars will have to take last orders for alcohol at 10 p.m. Some spectators will be allowed into sports events, though even in the least-affected parts of England, crowds will be limited to a maximum of 4,000, and in some parts of the country none will be allowed. The package outlined by Mr. Johnson reflected his desire to prevent another surge in virus cases while seeking not to antagonize his backbench lawmakers, who have threatened to rebel over lockdown measures. —

The governor of California is in quarantine with his family after a possible exposure. Dr. Haleh Farzanmehr administered a coronavirus test to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California last month at a testing facility in Valencia, Calif. Credit... Pool photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has gone into quarantine, along with his family, after three of the governor’s children were exposed to a state highway patrol officer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s whole family — Mr. Newsom; his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom; and their four children — tested negative for the virus on Sunday, but will stay apart from other people for two weeks anyway, in compliance with state guidelines, his office said. “We are grateful for all the officers that keep our family safe and for every frontline worker who continues to go to work during this pandemic,” the governor said on Twitter. The Newsoms learned of the exposure on Friday evening, the governor’s office said. The whole family waited until Sunday to be tested in order to reduce the likelihood of a false negative result (it can take time for the virus to build up to detectable levels after infection). The governor and his partner did not come in direct contact with the officer. One of the Newsom children was already in quarantine after a classmate tested positive, Politico reported on Friday. The governor has come under fire for sending his children back to their private school classrooms while many public schools in the state remained closed and most families had to adapt to at-home learning. Mr. Newsom has also faced outrage over his recent decision to attend a birthday dinner at a restaurant in Napa Valley with members of several other households. With infections and hospitalizations each rising at an alarming rate in the state, officials announced a curfew last week, and some counties and the state have reimposed sweeping restrictions they had been gradually lifting. According to a New York Times database, the state has reported an average of 11,802 new cases a day over the last week, a sharp increase from a month ago. The figure exceeds the state’s earlier peak of just over 10,000 new cases a day in late July. The curfew bars nearly all Californians from being away from their homes from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for essential purposes, and is scheduled to last through Dec. 21. In Los Angeles County, where indoor dining has been shuttered for months and virus cases are still surging, health officials took the additional step on Sunday of closing down outdoor dining “to reduce the possibility for crowding and the potential for exposure.” That order takes effect on Wednesday, just before Thanksgiving. —

A C.D.C. advisory group discussed which Americans should get vaccines first. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the C.D.C. indicated in a meeting on Monday that health care workers should be the first recipients of coronavirus vaccines. Credit... Go Nakamura/Getty Images An expert committee charged with deciding which Americans should be first in line for a coronavirus vaccine met on Monday afternoon to discuss a number of questions before it votes — likely by mid-December — on final recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After the group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, delivers its recommendations, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, will quickly decide whether to approve them. That will be the final step, after a review by the Food and Drug Administration and its own advisory committee on vaccines, before the first doses of vaccine are shipped nationwide. A subgroup of the committee had already suggested that health care workers, who total about 21 million, should be the first to be vaccinated. On Monday, it recommended also including residents of long-term care facilities in that initial group. Next would be essential workers, then adults with high-risk medical conditions and those who are 65 or older. Some of the questions the committee considered Monday included: Whether people who have already had Covid-19 should not be vaccinated until there is ample supply. Dr. Robert Atmar, a committee member and infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that “at the beginning, where it’s a resource-limited vaccine, my opinion is that we need to try and target as best we can to those that we know are susceptible.” But another committee member, Dr. Grace Lee, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, pushed back, saying that much remains unknown about long-term immunity.

Whether essential workers like police, firefighters, teachers and transportation workers should be the second group to get the vaccine. “To me, the issue of ethics is very significant, very important for this country and clearly favors the essential worker group,” said Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles, noting that the group included a “high proportion of minority, low-income and low-education workers.” —

A new analysis shows how political divisions impacted attitudes toward restrictions. Demonstrators protested ‘Stay Home, Stay Healthy’ orders in Washington State in April. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic last spring quickly became politicized, forcing officials and citizens around the world to choose between public health and personal freedom. In the United States, the tension broke down roughly along ideological lines, with many blue states taking containment measures seriously, and red states less so. In a new analysis, a team of researchers provided some of the first hard evidence of how the political divide drove behavior. The paper, posted Monday by the journal Nature Human Behavior, found that one measure of partisan hostility — the intensity of distrust and animosity toward the other side, red or blue — correlated both with people’s attitudes toward containment policies, and how they behaved. The findings were based on interviews with more than 2,400 adults, conducted once in the summer of 2019 and again in April of this year. The research team, led by James Druckman, a political scientist at Northwestern University, found that the average Democrat “is more worried, is more likely to have changed behaviors and is more supportive of policies to stop the spread of infections than the average Republican,” although there were substantial overlaps in attitudes. The research team, which included scientists from the University of Arizona, Stony Brook University and the University of Pennsylvania, determined that in the hardest hit areas, these differences shrank. In effect, concern for personal and family safety blunted the effect of partisanship, as most everyone responded to the local outbreak. “These findings have implications for understanding how best to combat COVID-19,” the authors concluded. Since partisan hostility underlies partisan gaps, “policymakers will need to devise different strategies to bring the parties together on these issues.” —

More than one million travelers were screened at airports on Sunday, a new high in the pandemic. Travelers at Miami International Airport on Sunday. Experts have been strongly discouraging holiday travel. Credit... David Santiago/Miami Herald, via Associated Press More travelers were screened at airport security checkpoints on Sunday than on any day since the pandemic took hold in March, a worrying sign that people flying to visit their families for Thanksgiving could increase the spread of the coronavirus. A little more than one million people were screened by the Transportation Security Administration on Sunday, according to federal data published on Monday. That number is about half of what it was in 2019, but it represents a big increase from the spring, when less than a half a million people flew on any given day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, have been strongly discouraging holiday travel for fear that it would increase the number of new infections, which have surged in recent weeks as the weather turns colder and more people spend time indoors. Airlines have said that flying is safe because of the precautions the industry has put in place, like high-end air filtration. They also point to the relatively few published cases of the coronavirus being spread during a flight. But the science on in-flight safety is far from settled, and travelers would still be at risk of contracting or spreading the virus at airports and once they are at their destination. The increase in travel during the holidays has been encouraging for airlines. But it won’t be enough to offset the deep losses they have suffered during the pandemic. The nation’s largest airlines have collectively reported tens of billions of dollars in losses so far this year, and analysts expect demand to remain weak for a couple of years or more. The industry is hoping that the incoming Biden administration and Congress will give airlines more aid early next year.

Jun Michael Park for The New York Times When a taxi deposited Mallory Guy in front of an apartment building in Cheonan, South Korea, after a 14-hour flight from Atlanta, a Korean couple was waiting for her with open arms. It was the first time since she was 7 months old that Ms. Guy, 33, had been in the country where she was born. It was also her first time seeing her birth parents since she was sent to the United States more than three decades ago. For some adoptees, birth family reunions had become a rite of passage. Then came the pandemic. The pilgrimages back to South Korea dwindled. Many adoptees canceled long-planned reunions after the government’s quarantine rules for foreign visitors made the trips too costly and time-consuming. When Ms. Guy arrived in South Korea in September, she did not know whether she would be allowed to spend the two weeks at her biological parents’ home or be forced to stay at a costly government hotel. The South Korean Embassy’s website said only that such decisions were made on a case-by-case basis. Her parents made Korean food for her and American snacks like peanut butter and jelly. (They also stocked up on milk, because they had heard that Americans love milk.) They even bought her an exercise bike, because she had told them during calls that she enjoyed using her Peloton. After two weeks of immersion in her parents’ home, Ms. Guy took a coronavirus test, as mandated by the government, so she could leave quarantine and explore her home country with her family. When a testing administrator asked her when she had last left the country for the United States, “I told her 1987, and she looked super-confused.” The worker asked again, and Ms. Guy confirmed that she understood the question. After telling her 1987 four more times, Ms. Guy said, “she finally wrote it down.” —

Tami Chappell/EPA, via Shutterstock Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, a Republican who is campaigning in a high-stakes runoff election that could determine control of the Senate, plans to get “back out on the campaign trail” after receiving her second consecutive negative coronavirus test, a campaign spokesman said on Monday. This comes after Ms. Loeffler’s campaign on Sunday said she was isolating “out of an abundance of caution” after a series of coronavirus tests delivered mixed messages about whether she had contracted the disease. According to Stephen Lawson, a campaign spokesman, a rapid test Ms. Loeffler took Friday morning came back negative, but a second test she also took that morning — a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test, which is considered more accurate — returned a positive result on Friday evening. In between her receipt of the two conflicting test results, Ms. Loeffler attended campaign-related events on Friday, including a rally with Vice President Mike Pence and Senator David Perdue of Georgia, Mr. Lawson said. Ms. Loeffler, 49, received another P.C.R. test on Saturday morning. But it was “inconclusive,” Mr. Lawson said of the results, which came in Saturday evening. On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lawson issued another statement saying that the senator’s “previously inconclusive P.C.R. results were retested overnight and the results thankfully came back negative.” The negative result on Monday was also from a P.C.R. test. He added: “Out of an abundance of caution, she will continue to self-isolate and be retested again to hopefully receive consecutive negative test results. We will share those results as they are made available. She will continue to confer with medical experts and follow C.D.C. guidelines.” Ms. Loeffler notified those with whom she had sustained contact while she awaits further test results, he said. Ms. Loeffler has held recent events with prominent Republicans, including Mr. Pence, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mr. Perdue, who is also engaged in a runoff election that could determine control of the Senate. On Sunday, a campaign spokesman said Mr. Perdue was remaining at home until he had more details about the health status of Ms. Loeffler. Mr. Perdue, 70, has encouraged people to wear masks to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. But he has also appeared at rallies where people did not wear masks. A Friday tweet from Ms. Loeffler includes a picture that shows the two senators in an indoor setting without masks. A spokesman for Mr. Pence, Devin O’Malley, said also on Sunday that “as he awaits a confirmatory test from Senator Loeffler, Vice President Pence is in regular consultation with the White House Medical Unit and will be following C.D.C. guidelines as he has in other circumstances when he has been a close contact.” The last time Mr. Pence was deemed a close contact was last month when his chief of staff, Marc Short, tested positive. Mr. Pence continued to campaign then, with the White House saying that he was performing “essential” duties that exempted him from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines calling for people to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to the virus. Ms. Loeffler, a businesswoman who is the Senate’s richest member, was temporarily appointed to her Senate seat late last year. She faces the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, in an election on Jan. 5, when Georgia voters will also decide between Mr. Perdue and his opponent, Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. — Richard Fausset, Annie Karni, Michael Levenson, Astead W.

Pakistan pauses in-person learning until January 2021. Students in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday. Credit... Shahzaib Akber/EPA, via Shutterstock ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan announced Monday that schools across the country will close for six weeks beginning Nov. 26 as the government confronts a sharp rise in new coronavirus cases. The positivity rate was 7 percent in the past 24 hours with at least 34 deaths, health officials said, a worrying increase compared to the past several weeks. Students will continue taking classes from home until Dec. 24, said Shafqat Mahmood, Pakistan’s federal education minister, during a news conference in Islamabad on Monday. “All educational institutions will be opened on Jan. 11, 2021, after reviewing Covid-19 cases situation in the first week of January,” Mr. Mahmood said, noting that winter break for students would begin Dec. 25 and end on Jan. 10. This is the second time Pakistan has closed schools, resorting to at-home learning back in March and only reopening classrooms in September. “If we don’t make important decisions now, there is a possibility that the spread of the virus will overburden the health care system,” Dr. Faisal Sultan, the special assistant to the Pakistan prime minister on health, said Monday. Pakistan was spared the kind of devastation that crippled other countries this past spring, and officials had expressed optimism that they were prepared for the second wave. But a new wave of infections has now raised concerns about the government’s ability to counter the virus. To date, there have been more than 376,000 recorded cases of coronavirus and nearly 7,700 deaths, according to a Times database. The current daily average number of new cases in Pakistan stands at 2,557. —

As Italy struggles to distribute flu shots, worries mount about its ability to handle virus vaccines. Health workers carried out flu vaccinations at a hospital in Milan, Italy, this month. Credit... Andrea Fasani/EPA, via Shutterstock After suffering through two big outbreaks of the coronavirus, many people in Italy greeted news that a vaccine could be available by early next year with some optimism. But one of the country’s most renowned virologists and Covid-19 experts has provided a reality check about the country’s ability to carry out a mass vaccination drive. He says he hasn’t even been able to get a simple flu shot. “It’s a real scandal,” Dr. Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious disease department at the Sacco hospital in Milan, said Sunday on Italian television. He said that while he hoped the country would eventually be able to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to its citizens, the outlook was “ghastly.” That Dr. Galli, who is 69 and among the most recognizable coronavirus experts in the country, could not get his hands on a simple flu vaccine renewed concerns about a potential lack of preparedness to procure and distribute coronavirus vaccines. Flu shots are far less common in Italy than in the United States, but Italy’s health authorities had urged people to get them this year, both to keep healthy and to allow doctors to focus on Covid-19 patients. But five months later, flu shots are few and far between, and millions of Italians, including older adults and patients with pre-existing conditions, haven’t been able to get them. Some experts say that Italy’s regions, which control health care systems within their borders, placed their orders too late amid enormously high demand in the international marketplace. Regional authorities have instead attributed the shortage to delays by the providers. In the hard-hit Serio valley in northern Italy, Dr. Mario Sorlini said a much higher than usual number of patients asked to be vaccinated for the flu. But the region only sent him about half the doses he received last year. “We were the hardest hit province by Covid, and I was only able to do 25 percent of the flu vaccines I have to do,” Dr. Sorlini said, adding that if he and his colleagues did not receive the doses before the flu comes, it will be a “disaster on top of a disaster.” —

The A.C.L.U. sues a Nebraska meatpacking plant over measures to protect workers from the coronavirus. The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sued a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, alleging that it failed to take measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among workers and, as a result, also imperiled the surrounding community. The lawsuit was filed against Noah’s Ark Processors, which operates a beef-processing plant in Hastings, Neb. Among the plaintiffs are former plant employees and a local pediatrician who has treated children of meatpacking workers as well as people infected with the coronavirus. Noah’s Ark refused to take precautionary measures such as implementing physical distancing, distributing appropriate protective gear or conducting testing for the virus, according to the lawsuit. The plant also kept ailing workers on the job and forced them to wear masks soiled with blood, fat and sweat, the suit said. The meatpacking plant declined to comment. Often immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa, tens of thousands of workers in poultry- and meat-processing plants across the country have fallen ill from the virus and more than 220 have died. They typically toil in cold facilities, standing shoulder to shoulder on production lines and on kill floors. In Nebraska, Hispanics comprise 11 percent of the population but accounted for 60 percent of coronavirus cases in July, according to data released by the state’s health department, because many of them work in the food-processing industry. Despite legislative advocacy and numerous complaints, local, state and federal authorities have failed to require the establishment of safety standards in Nebraska’s meatpacking plants during the pandemic, according to the A.C.L.U., and there has been no significant enforcement action taken against any facility. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring that the plant implement four safeguards: physical distancing, clean masks, sick leave and testing. Attorneys with the A.C.L.U. said they hoped that the measures would serve as a baseline for facilities nationwide. Spencer Amdur, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said that Noah’s Ark had shown “shocking indifference” to its workers by failing to take “common-sense steps.” “Every plant should be providing these basic protections,” said Mr. Amdur. “Without them, workers and others in the community face imminent and severe harm.” —

Los Angeles restaurants brace for new dining restrictions. Some restaurant owners in Los Angeles were upset about new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas. Credit... Ryan Christopher Jones for The New York Times Los Angeles restaurants, many already struggling since indoor dining was disallowed earlier this year, received another blow over the weekend when county health officials announced outdoor dining would also end for three weeks beginning on Wednesday. While restaurants will still be allowed to do takeout and delivery, the timing of the new restrictions couldn’t be worse. The approaching holiday season is usually the busiest period of the year, when many restaurants make the money they need to survive the leaner months of January and February. “Nothing will be the same,” the chef David Chang, the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, which operates Majordomo in Los Angeles, wrote on Twitter. “Even if you survive until spring, it’s 3-5 months before tourism returns and office/corporate business will not come back as before.” On Monday, restaurant owners and chefs scrambled to cancel Thanksgiving reservations while preparing to once again furlough employees. The restaurant Castaway in Burbank had 625 reservations for Thanksgiving lunch and dinner, said John Tallichet, the chief executive of Specialty Restaurants Corporation, which had four restaurants offering outside dining in Los Angeles County. While some of that food will be sold as Thanksgiving meals to go, Mr. Tallichet said much of it will go to the employees he will furlough for three weeks, if not longer. Before the pandemic, Castaway employed 200 people. That number has since dropped to 80 and will fall to around 10 employees as it shifts to a takeout business. “I’m guessing we’re going to be shut down through the holidays,” he said. “Why allow us to operate for New Year’s and Christmas if they’re concerned now? So we’re taking that food and creating care packages for our employees to take home so at least they have a nice Thanksgiving meal.” Some restaurant owners were upset about the new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots and elsewhere with the belief that they would be allowed to continue serving customers that way. “These restaurants have invested $30,000 to $50,000 in outdoor heaters and tents, being told all of this is allowable and safe and now they’re told, ‘nope, all of that investment was a waste,’” said Jot Condie, the president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, a trade organization representing the industry. Restaurants all around the country are struggling with changing rules and consumer preferences as coronavirus cases rise. Last Friday, the New York restaurateur Danny Meyer announced that three of his restaurants, including Gramercy Tavern, would close for on-premises dining, but continue to offer takeout meals. —

It’s not just the Midwest: The U.S. outbreak is accelerating all over the map. A drive-through testing site in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times When infections began rising sharply in the U.S. in September, the growth was driven largely by outbreaks in the Upper Midwest. States like North Dakota and Wisconsin soon became the hardest hit in the nation, relative to their size, and the region continues to struggle. Now, though, with the whole country’s daily average of new cases is as high as it has ever been — over 171,000 — the most rapid growth is happening elsewhere. Nine states are reporting more than twice as many new cases a day as they did two weeks ago, and none of them are in the Midwest. The surges in those states — Arizona, California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Vermont — reflect a still-escalating national crisis. Officials warn that it will only get worse if people disregard warnings about travel and get-togethers for the approaching holidays. “Let me be very clear: A Thanksgiving gathering this year may very well lead to a funeral,” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, whose state is home to five of the 10 metropolitan areas in the country where new case reports are rising the fastest. “The virus is at large,” the governor said. “Know the risks and respect them.” Forty-five states are seeing sustained increases, and 17 states added more cases in the seven-day period that ended Sunday than in any other week of the pandemic. Major metropolitan areas that are reporting new cases at or near record levels are all across the continent: Pittsburgh. Albuquerque. Baltimore. San Diego. Some that have been bad for a while, like El Paso, are coping with the flood of hospitalizations that generally follow a couple of weeks behind a rising tide of new cases. A major hospital group in Arizona, Banner Health, began banning most visitors from its facilities Sunday night because of the worsening spread of the virus.



And where the hospitals come under intense strain, officials are turning, however reluctantly, to impose or reimpose restrictions in the hope of flattening the curve. In Los Angeles County, Calif., which has been averaging more than 3,500 cases a day lately, officials said on Sunday that barring indoor restaurant dining was no longer sufficient, and that outdoor dining would have to shut down as well. “Unfortunately, if our cases and hospitalizations continue to increase, we will need to issue further restrictions to protect our health care system and prevent more deaths,” said Barbara Ferrer, the county public health director. —

AstraZeneca becomes the third major vaccine developer to announce promising results. A volunteer in Oxford, England, last week received the vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times The drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that an early analysis of some of its late-stage clinical trials, conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, showed that its coronavirus vaccine was 70.4 percent effective in preventing Covid-19, suggesting that the world could eventually have at least three working vaccines — and more supply — to help curb the pandemic. The British-Swedish company, which has been developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the third major vaccine developer this month to announce encouraging early results, following Pfizer and Moderna, which both said that their vaccines were about 95 percent effective in late-stage studies. AstraZeneca’s results are a reassuring sign of the safety of the vaccine. It came under global scrutiny after AstraZeneca temporarily paused its trials in September to investigate potential safety issues after a participant in Britain developed a neurological illness. Oxford and AstraZeneca said they would submit their data to regulators in Britain, Europe and Brazil and seek emergency authorization. The company said its early analysis was based on 131 coronavirus cases. The trials used two different dosing regimens, one of which was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 and the other of which was 62 percent effective. The regimen that was 90 percent effective involved using a halved first dose and a standard second dose. Oxford and AstraZeneca also said that there were no hospitalized or severe cases of the coronavirus in anyone who received the vaccine, and that they had seen a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine could reduce transmission. AstraZeneca’s vaccine is expected to come with relatively simple storage requirements, which would be an asset once it gets rolled out. The company has said it anticipates the vaccine will require refrigeration, though it has not provided details about how long and at what temperature it can be kept. Moderna’s vaccine can be kept for up to a month at the temperature of an ordinary refrigerator. Pfizer’s can be kept for up to 5 days in conventional refrigerators, or in special coolers for up to 15 days, but otherwise needs ultracold storage. AstraZeneca has said it aims to bring data from its studies of its vaccine being conducted overseas to the Food and Drug Administration — which would mean that the agency will likely review and authorize a vaccine before late-stage data are ready on how well the vaccine works in American participants. British regulators already have been conducting a so-called rolling review of the vaccine. “Today marks an important milestone in our fight against the pandemic,” AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said. “This vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against Covid-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency.” Professor Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said that “these findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives.” AstraZeneca’s results could significantly strengthen the global effort to produce enough vaccine to create population immunity: The price of the shot, at $3 to $4, is a fraction of that of some other potential vaccines, and AstraZeneca has pledged to make it available at cost around the world until at least July 2021 and in poorer countries in perpetuity. — Rebecca Robbins, Benjamin Mueller and

Cuomo announces new restrictions in Upper Manhattan, Staten Island and other hot spots. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:43 - 0:00 transcript Cuomo Announces New Virus Restrictions Ahead of Thanksgiving Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. We are now coming into the high social season — Thanksgiving, Christmas. It’s the high social season, social activity goes way up in this season. That is a bad combination. Just factor out the current rate of increase. You know, where we are in three weeks? Six thousand cases. That’s before we go into 37 days of the highest socialization period of the year. Yellow Zone in New York City is 2.5, reduces house of worship gatherings. Orange Zone reduces mass gatherings, more businesses close; high risk in an Orange Zone, schools close to clean and test, and then can reopen if they test and the positivity rate is low. New York City, Upper Manhattan is going to become a Yellow Zone. Basically, the Washington Heights area is 3.3. Staten Island, part is a Yellow Zone, part is an Orange Zone. Staten Island is a problem. The number of hospitalizations in Staten Island have gone — over the last three weeks — they basically tripled 33 to 91. It’s a consequence of action. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. Credit Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times As Thanksgiving approaches, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Monday announced new restrictions in parts of the state where virus cases are rising, including New York City, and issued a grim warning that the state was on track for a further resurgence of the virus. The new restrictions included a zone in Upper Manhattan, the first time the state has rolled back reopening in the borough under its program of targeting so-called microclusters. “These are dangerous times that we’re in,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in New York City. Over the last three weeks, the number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state has more than doubled, to 2,724 on Monday from 1,227 on Nov. 2. The number is a far cry from the peak of the pandemic in the spring, when more than 18,000 people were hospitalized. But Mr. Cuomo warned that if current patterns held, the state would hit 6,000 hospitalizations in another three weeks. The increase could become steeper, he said, if people continued gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas in the coming weeks, which he called “37 days of the highest socialization of the year.” The governor again warned residents not to travel for the holidays. The state has currently imposed a 10-person limit on private gatherings in hopes of limiting small parties that he has said have contributed to the resurgence of the virus in the state this fall. Parts of Upper Manhattan, including Washington Heights, will now be a yellow zone under the state’s tiered, color-coded restriction system. Gatherings will be limited to 25 people, with houses of worship limited to 50 percent capacity. Restaurants can serve only up to 4 people at a table. Mr. Cuomo also announced an orange zone, the second level of limits, in southern parts of Staten Island. In those areas, indoor dining will close, as will some nonessential businesses deemed to be high risk, such as gyms and personal-care services. All gatherings will be limited to 10 people, with houses of worship limited to 33 percent capacity and 25 people maximum. Other parts of the borough will become a yellow zone. “Staten Island is a problem,” Mr. Cuomo said. The borough has been a hot spot for the virus in the city in recent months. Mr. Cuomo said that hospitalizations there had increased enough that Staten Island was facing a capacity issue. As a result, the state will open an emergency coronavirus patient facility in the South Beach neighborhood, a move reminiscent of field hospitals set up in the spring, when New York City was one of the hardest hit places in the country. The state also announced new yellow zones in parts of Long Island, including Great Neck, Riverhead and Hampton Bays, and expanded yellow and orange zones upstate, around the cities of Rochester and Syracuse. —

Boris Johnson will lift restrictions on many businesses in England beginning next week. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript England Will Lift Coronavirus Restrictions The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. The national restrictions in England will end on the 2nd of December, and they will not be renewed. From next Wednesday, people will be able to leave their home for any purpose, and meet others in outdoor public spaces subject to the Rule of 6. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen. But without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a winter or new-year surge. The incidence of the disease is, alas, still widespread in many areas. So we’re not going to replace national measures with a free for all — the status quo ante-Covid — we’re going to go back instead to a regional tiered approach, applying the toughest measures where Covid is most prevalent. I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year. But in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. We all want some kind of Christmas. We need it. We certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. Credit Credit... Tolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Gyms, stores and hair salons will be allowed to reopen in England next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday, telling lawmakers that for the first time since the spread of the coronavirus the country could “see a route out of the pandemic.” Speaking to Parliament by video link, Mr. Johnson said that he would lift a national lockdown on Dec. 2, as expected, and that England would then return to a regionalized system of restrictions based on three tiers of controls. However, the new plan will keep substantial restrictions on pubs and restaurants — a move that risks friction with some of Mr. Johnson’s own lawmakers, who fear that the hospitality trade will be hit hard by the limitations. Crucially, the government has not yet announced which parts of the country will be subjected to which set of restrictions, though that information is expected later this week. Mr. Johnson, who has been quarantining since last week after being exposed to a member of Parliament who tested positive, hailed the progress announced by the team at Oxford University developing a vaccine with the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, adding that the “scientific cavalry is in sight.” There have been at least 1.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to Public Health England. As of Monday morning, 55,024 people had died. United Kingdom Covid Map and Case Count A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. Under the plan to ease restrictions, gyms, stores and hair salons will reopen and collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports will be allowed to resume in all parts of England. But in the worst-affected parts of the country, pubs and restaurants will stay closed except for takeout service. In some other areas, people will only be able to drink in pubs if they are also eating a meal. Those pubs will, however, be allowed to stay open until 11 p.m., an hour later than had been allowed immediately before the lockdown began, though the bars will have to take last orders for alcohol at 10 p.m. Some spectators will be allowed into sports events, though even in the least-affected parts of England, crowds will be limited to a maximum of 4,000, and in some parts of the country none will be allowed. The package outlined by Mr. Johnson reflected his desire to prevent another surge in virus cases while seeking not to antagonize his backbench lawmakers, who have threatened to rebel over lockdown measures. —

The governor of California is in quarantine with his family after a possible exposure. Dr. Haleh Farzanmehr administered a coronavirus test to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California last month at a testing facility in Valencia, Calif. Credit... Pool photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has gone into quarantine, along with his family, after three of the governor’s children were exposed to a state highway patrol officer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s whole family — Mr. Newsom; his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom; and their four children — tested negative for the virus on Sunday, but will stay apart from other people for two weeks anyway, in compliance with state guidelines, his office said. “We are grateful for all the officers that keep our family safe and for every frontline worker who continues to go to work during this pandemic,” the governor said on Twitter. The Newsoms learned of the exposure on Friday evening, the governor’s office said. The whole family waited until Sunday to be tested in order to reduce the likelihood of a false negative result (it can take time for the virus to build up to detectable levels after infection). The governor and his partner did not come in direct contact with the officer. One of the Newsom children was already in quarantine after a classmate tested positive, Politico reported on Friday. The governor has come under fire for sending his children back to their private school classrooms while many public schools in the state remained closed and most families had to adapt to at-home learning. Mr. Newsom has also faced outrage over his recent decision to attend a birthday dinner at a restaurant in Napa Valley with members of several other households. With infections and hospitalizations each rising at an alarming rate in the state, officials announced a curfew last week, and some counties and the state have reimposed sweeping restrictions they had been gradually lifting. According to a New York Times database, the state has reported an average of 11,802 new cases a day over the last week, a sharp increase from a month ago. The figure exceeds the state’s earlier peak of just over 10,000 new cases a day in late July. The curfew bars nearly all Californians from being away from their homes from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for essential purposes, and is scheduled to last through Dec. 21. In Los Angeles County, where indoor dining has been shuttered for months and virus cases are still surging, health officials took the additional step on Sunday of closing down outdoor dining “to reduce the possibility for crowding and the potential for exposure.” That order takes effect on Wednesday, just before Thanksgiving. —

A C.D.C. advisory group discussed which Americans should get vaccines first. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the C.D.C. indicated in a meeting on Monday that health care workers should be the first recipients of coronavirus vaccines. Credit... Go Nakamura/Getty Images An expert committee charged with deciding which Americans should be first in line for a coronavirus vaccine met on Monday afternoon to discuss a number of questions before it votes — likely by mid-December — on final recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After the group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, delivers its recommendations, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, will quickly decide whether to approve them. That will be the final step, after a review by the Food and Drug Administration and its own advisory committee on vaccines, before the first doses of vaccine are shipped nationwide. A subgroup of the committee had already suggested that health care workers, who total about 21 million, should be the first to be vaccinated. On Monday, it recommended also including residents of long-term care facilities in that initial group. Next would be essential workers, then adults with high-risk medical conditions and those who are 65 or older. Some of the questions the committee considered Monday included: Whether people who have already had Covid-19 should not be vaccinated until there is ample supply. Dr. Robert Atmar, a committee member and infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that “at the beginning, where it’s a resource-limited vaccine, my opinion is that we need to try and target as best we can to those that we know are susceptible.” But another committee member, Dr. Grace Lee, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, pushed back, saying that much remains unknown about long-term immunity.

Whether essential workers like police, firefighters, teachers and transportation workers should be the second group to get the vaccine. “To me, the issue of ethics is very significant, very important for this country and clearly favors the essential worker group,” said Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles, noting that the group included a “high proportion of minority, low-income and low-education workers.” —

A new analysis shows how political divisions impacted attitudes toward restrictions. Demonstrators protested ‘Stay Home, Stay Healthy’ orders in Washington State in April. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic last spring quickly became politicized, forcing officials and citizens around the world to choose between public health and personal freedom. In the United States, the tension broke down roughly along ideological lines, with many blue states taking containment measures seriously, and red states less so. In a new analysis, a team of researchers provided some of the first hard evidence of how the political divide drove behavior. The paper, posted Monday by the journal Nature Human Behavior, found that one measure of partisan hostility — the intensity of distrust and animosity toward the other side, red or blue — correlated both with people’s attitudes toward containment policies, and how they behaved. The findings were based on interviews with more than 2,400 adults, conducted once in the summer of 2019 and again in April of this year. The research team, led by James Druckman, a political scientist at Northwestern University, found that the average Democrat “is more worried, is more likely to have changed behaviors and is more supportive of policies to stop the spread of infections than the average Republican,” although there were substantial overlaps in attitudes. The research team, which included scientists from the University of Arizona, Stony Brook University and the University of Pennsylvania, determined that in the hardest hit areas, these differences shrank. In effect, concern for personal and family safety blunted the effect of partisanship, as most everyone responded to the local outbreak. “These findings have implications for understanding how best to combat COVID-19,” the authors concluded. Since partisan hostility underlies partisan gaps, “policymakers will need to devise different strategies to bring the parties together on these issues.” —

David Santiago/Miami Herald, via Associated Press More travelers were screened at airport security checkpoints on Sunday than on any day since the pandemic took hold in March, a worrying sign that people flying to visit their families for Thanksgiving could increase the spread of the coronavirus. A little more than one million people were screened by the Transportation Security Administration on Sunday, according to federal data published on Monday. That number is about half of what it was in 2019, but it represents a big increase from the spring, when less than a half a million people flew on any given day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, have been strongly discouraging holiday travel for fear that it would increase the number of new infections, which have surged in recent weeks as the weather turns colder and more people spend time indoors. Airlines have said that flying is safe because of the precautions the industry has put in place, like high-end air filtration. They also point to the relatively few published cases of the coronavirus being spread during a flight. But the science on in-flight safety is far from settled, and travelers would still be at risk of contracting or spreading the virus at airports and once they are at their destination. The increase in travel during the holidays has been encouraging for airlines. But it won’t be enough to offset the deep losses they have suffered during the pandemic. The nation’s largest airlines have collectively reported tens of billions of dollars in losses so far this year, and analysts expect demand to remain weak for a couple of years or more. The industry is hoping that the incoming Biden administration and Congress will give airlines more aid early next year.

Adoptee reunions were disrupted by the pandemic. Some still found a way. Mallory Guy, right, used a translation app to communicate with her birth mother, Lim Mi-Soon. Credit... Jun Michael Park for The New York Times When a taxi deposited Mallory Guy in front of an apartment building in Cheonan, South Korea, after a 14-hour flight from Atlanta, a Korean couple was waiting for her with open arms. It was the first time since she was 7 months old that Ms. Guy, 33, had been in the country where she was born. It was also her first time seeing her birth parents since she was sent to the United States more than three decades ago. For some adoptees, birth family reunions had become a rite of passage. Then came the pandemic. The pilgrimages back to South Korea dwindled. Many adoptees canceled long-planned reunions after the government’s quarantine rules for foreign visitors made the trips too costly and time-consuming. When Ms. Guy arrived in South Korea in September, she did not know whether she would be allowed to spend the two weeks at her biological parents’ home or be forced to stay at a costly government hotel. The South Korean Embassy’s website said only that such decisions were made on a case-by-case basis. Her parents made Korean food for her and American snacks like peanut butter and jelly. (They also stocked up on milk, because they had heard that Americans love milk.) They even bought her an exercise bike, because she had told them during calls that she enjoyed using her Peloton. After two weeks of immersion in her parents’ home, Ms. Guy took a coronavirus test, as mandated by the government, so she could leave quarantine and explore her home country with her family. When a testing administrator asked her when she had last left the country for the United States, “I told her 1987, and she looked super-confused.” The worker asked again, and Ms. Guy confirmed that she understood the question. After telling her 1987 four more times, Ms. Guy said, “she finally wrote it down.” —

Tami Chappell/EPA, via Shutterstock Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, a Republican who is campaigning in a high-stakes runoff election that could determine control of the Senate, plans to get “back out on the campaign trail” after receiving her second consecutive negative coronavirus test, a campaign spokesman said on Monday. This comes after Ms. Loeffler’s campaign on Sunday said she was isolating “out of an abundance of caution” after a series of coronavirus tests delivered mixed messages about whether she had contracted the disease. According to Stephen Lawson, a campaign spokesman, a rapid test Ms. Loeffler took Friday morning came back negative, but a second test she also took that morning — a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test, which is considered more accurate — returned a positive result on Friday evening. In between her receipt of the two conflicting test results, Ms. Loeffler attended campaign-related events on Friday, including a rally with Vice President Mike Pence and Senator David Perdue of Georgia, Mr. Lawson said. Ms. Loeffler, 49, received another P.C.R. test on Saturday morning. But it was “inconclusive,” Mr. Lawson said of the results, which came in Saturday evening. On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lawson issued another statement saying that the senator’s “previously inconclusive P.C.R. results were retested overnight and the results thankfully came back negative.” The negative result on Monday was also from a P.C.R. test. He added: “Out of an abundance of caution, she will continue to self-isolate and be retested again to hopefully receive consecutive negative test results. We will share those results as they are made available. She will continue to confer with medical experts and follow C.D.C. guidelines.” Ms. Loeffler notified those with whom she had sustained contact while she awaits further test results, he said. Ms. Loeffler has held recent events with prominent Republicans, including Mr. Pence, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mr. Perdue, who is also engaged in a runoff election that could determine control of the Senate. On Sunday, a campaign spokesman said Mr. Perdue was remaining at home until he had more details about the health status of Ms. Loeffler. Mr. Perdue, 70, has encouraged people to wear masks to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. But he has also appeared at rallies where people did not wear masks. A Friday tweet from Ms. Loeffler includes a picture that shows the two senators in an indoor setting without masks. A spokesman for Mr. Pence, Devin O’Malley, said also on Sunday that “as he awaits a confirmatory test from Senator Loeffler, Vice President Pence is in regular consultation with the White House Medical Unit and will be following C.D.C. guidelines as he has in other circumstances when he has been a close contact.” The last time Mr. Pence was deemed a close contact was last month when his chief of staff, Marc Short, tested positive. Mr. Pence continued to campaign then, with the White House saying that he was performing “essential” duties that exempted him from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines calling for people to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to the virus. Ms. Loeffler, a businesswoman who is the Senate’s richest member, was temporarily appointed to her Senate seat late last year. She faces the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, in an election on Jan. 5, when Georgia voters will also decide between Mr. Perdue and his opponent, Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. — Richard Fausset, Annie Karni, Michael Levenson, Astead W.

Pakistan pauses in-person learning until January 2021. Students in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday. Credit... Shahzaib Akber/EPA, via Shutterstock ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan announced Monday that schools across the country will close for six weeks beginning Nov. 26 as the government confronts a sharp rise in new coronavirus cases. The positivity rate was 7 percent in the past 24 hours with at least 34 deaths, health officials said, a worrying increase compared to the past several weeks. Students will continue taking classes from home until Dec. 24, said Shafqat Mahmood, Pakistan’s federal education minister, during a news conference in Islamabad on Monday. “All educational institutions will be opened on Jan. 11, 2021, after reviewing Covid-19 cases situation in the first week of January,” Mr. Mahmood said, noting that winter break for students would begin Dec. 25 and end on Jan. 10. This is the second time Pakistan has closed schools, resorting to at-home learning back in March and only reopening classrooms in September. “If we don’t make important decisions now, there is a possibility that the spread of the virus will overburden the health care system,” Dr. Faisal Sultan, the special assistant to the Pakistan prime minister on health, said Monday. Pakistan was spared the kind of devastation that crippled other countries this past spring, and officials had expressed optimism that they were prepared for the second wave. But a new wave of infections has now raised concerns about the government’s ability to counter the virus. To date, there have been more than 376,000 recorded cases of coronavirus and nearly 7,700 deaths, according to a Times database. The current daily average number of new cases in Pakistan stands at 2,557. —

As Italy struggles to distribute flu shots, worries mount about its ability to handle virus vaccines. Health workers carried out flu vaccinations at a hospital in Milan, Italy, this month. Credit... Andrea Fasani/EPA, via Shutterstock After suffering through two big outbreaks of the coronavirus, many people in Italy greeted news that a vaccine could be available by early next year with some optimism. But one of the country’s most renowned virologists and Covid-19 experts has provided a reality check about the country’s ability to carry out a mass vaccination drive. He says he hasn’t even been able to get a simple flu shot. “It’s a real scandal,” Dr. Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious disease department at the Sacco hospital in Milan, said Sunday on Italian television. He said that while he hoped the country would eventually be able to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to its citizens, the outlook was “ghastly.” That Dr. Galli, who is 69 and among the most recognizable coronavirus experts in the country, could not get his hands on a simple flu vaccine renewed concerns about a potential lack of preparedness to procure and distribute coronavirus vaccines. Flu shots are far less common in Italy than in the United States, but Italy’s health authorities had urged people to get them this year, both to keep healthy and to allow doctors to focus on Covid-19 patients. But five months later, flu shots are few and far between, and millions of Italians, including older adults and patients with pre-existing conditions, haven’t been able to get them. Some experts say that Italy’s regions, which control health care systems within their borders, placed their orders too late amid enormously high demand in the international marketplace. Regional authorities have instead attributed the shortage to delays by the providers. In the hard-hit Serio valley in northern Italy, Dr. Mario Sorlini said a much higher than usual number of patients asked to be vaccinated for the flu. But the region only sent him about half the doses he received last year. “We were the hardest hit province by Covid, and I was only able to do 25 percent of the flu vaccines I have to do,” Dr. Sorlini said, adding that if he and his colleagues did not receive the doses before the flu comes, it will be a “disaster on top of a disaster.” —

The A.C.L.U. sues a Nebraska meatpacking plant over measures to protect workers from the coronavirus. The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sued a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, alleging that it failed to take measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among workers and, as a result, also imperiled the surrounding community. The lawsuit was filed against Noah’s Ark Processors, which operates a beef-processing plant in Hastings, Neb. Among the plaintiffs are former plant employees and a local pediatrician who has treated children of meatpacking workers as well as people infected with the coronavirus. Noah’s Ark refused to take precautionary measures such as implementing physical distancing, distributing appropriate protective gear or conducting testing for the virus, according to the lawsuit. The plant also kept ailing workers on the job and forced them to wear masks soiled with blood, fat and sweat, the suit said. The meatpacking plant declined to comment. Often immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa, tens of thousands of workers in poultry- and meat-processing plants across the country have fallen ill from the virus and more than 220 have died. They typically toil in cold facilities, standing shoulder to shoulder on production lines and on kill floors. In Nebraska, Hispanics comprise 11 percent of the population but accounted for 60 percent of coronavirus cases in July, according to data released by the state’s health department, because many of them work in the food-processing industry. Despite legislative advocacy and numerous complaints, local, state and federal authorities have failed to require the establishment of safety standards in Nebraska’s meatpacking plants during the pandemic, according to the A.C.L.U., and there has been no significant enforcement action taken against any facility. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring that the plant implement four safeguards: physical distancing, clean masks, sick leave and testing. Attorneys with the A.C.L.U. said they hoped that the measures would serve as a baseline for facilities nationwide. Spencer Amdur, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said that Noah’s Ark had shown “shocking indifference” to its workers by failing to take “common-sense steps.” “Every plant should be providing these basic protections,” said Mr. Amdur. “Without them, workers and others in the community face imminent and severe harm.” —

Los Angeles restaurants brace for new dining restrictions. Some restaurant owners in Los Angeles were upset about new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas. Credit... Ryan Christopher Jones for The New York Times Los Angeles restaurants, many already struggling since indoor dining was disallowed earlier this year, received another blow over the weekend when county health officials announced outdoor dining would also end for three weeks beginning on Wednesday. While restaurants will still be allowed to do takeout and delivery, the timing of the new restrictions couldn’t be worse. The approaching holiday season is usually the busiest period of the year, when many restaurants make the money they need to survive the leaner months of January and February. “Nothing will be the same,” the chef David Chang, the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, which operates Majordomo in Los Angeles, wrote on Twitter. “Even if you survive until spring, it’s 3-5 months before tourism returns and office/corporate business will not come back as before.” On Monday, restaurant owners and chefs scrambled to cancel Thanksgiving reservations while preparing to once again furlough employees. The restaurant Castaway in Burbank had 625 reservations for Thanksgiving lunch and dinner, said John Tallichet, the chief executive of Specialty Restaurants Corporation, which had four restaurants offering outside dining in Los Angeles County. While some of that food will be sold as Thanksgiving meals to go, Mr. Tallichet said much of it will go to the employees he will furlough for three weeks, if not longer. Before the pandemic, Castaway employed 200 people. That number has since dropped to 80 and will fall to around 10 employees as it shifts to a takeout business. “I’m guessing we’re going to be shut down through the holidays,” he said. “Why allow us to operate for New Year’s and Christmas if they’re concerned now? So we’re taking that food and creating care packages for our employees to take home so at least they have a nice Thanksgiving meal.” Some restaurant owners were upset about the new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots and elsewhere with the belief that they would be allowed to continue serving customers that way. “These restaurants have invested $30,000 to $50,000 in outdoor heaters and tents, being told all of this is allowable and safe and now they’re told, ‘nope, all of that investment was a waste,’” said Jot Condie, the president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, a trade organization representing the industry. Restaurants all around the country are struggling with changing rules and consumer preferences as coronavirus cases rise. Last Friday, the New York restaurateur Danny Meyer announced that three of his restaurants, including Gramercy Tavern, would close for on-premises dining, but continue to offer takeout meals. —

How to instill public confidence in a Covid-19 vaccineFew measures in preventive medicine can compare with the impact of vaccines.

(CNN) Few measures in preventive medicine can compare with the impact of vaccines. In fact, the only human disease ever eradicated, smallpox, was wiped out with a vaccine. Given the major health burden caused by the novel coronavirus, having a safe and effective vaccine would be a critical tool in mitigating that burden.

Headlines as of late have painted a grim picture of the immediate public health landscape, with Covid-19 cases spiking across the nation and some cities and states forced to implement new regulations in an attempt to stymie the spread of disease. But amid the bad news, there has been a glimmer of hope. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that early data on their vaccine candidate showed it was more than 90% effective in trial participants, before announcing on Wednesday that a final analysis of the vaccine's Phase 3 trial found it was 95% effective. And on Monday, Moderna reported that early data from its vaccine candidate shows it is over 94% effective.

These promising news, however, are likely to raise some eyebrows, as they come along side skepticism that any Covid-19 vaccine developed on an expedited timeline may not be as thoroughly vetted as traditional vaccines. Emergency use authorization (EUA) can indeed be granted by the FDA to allow a vaccine to bypass some of the time-consuming approval processes that would delay its availability to the public. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla announced this week that the company is preparing to file for EUA on Friday

Some of this concern is warranted; it is critical that a vaccine is proved to be safe and effective before it is publicly available to assure it will reduce the disease burden and not cause undue harm. However, if a vaccine candidate is proved to be safe and beneficial to the public, it becomes imperative that it is widely administered.

So, what can be done now to instill public confidence in a vaccine if and when it proves to meet public health standards and scientific muster?

Transparency

Developing a vaccine and making it available for public use is a major undertaking. First, substantial preclinical work is needed to determine what is a likely protective immune response for the virus in question and then how to induce it. Once the preclinical work is done, three major stages of clinical trials traditionally follow before licensure is possible. By the time a vaccine makes it through these trials, thousands or even tens of thousands of volunteers may have received it and data on the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the incidence of illness compared to a placebo typically provides proof of its efficacy. So far, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine trials have included tens of thousands of individuals , divided into groups of those receiving the vaccine and those getting a placebo.

But these companies may soon deviate from the traditional vaccine approval process by filing for an EUA from the US Food and Drug Administration to make their vaccines available to the public as soon as possible. Given this expedited timeline, the authorization process must be transparent and clearly communicated to the public to instill confidence that no shortcuts were taken that could result in harm to those who get vaccinated. To facilitate this, investments should be made in developing appropriate communications materials to help explain the vaccine trial and approval process to the public and to health care provider groups.

Committee meetings in a public forum

To ensure vaccine safety and provide an opportunity for the public to observe the data being discussed, vaccine trials should be reviewed by independent committees of experts in a public forum prior to vaccine approval and as administration programs are considered. Opportunities for public comments to the committees should also be prioritized. By doing this, concerned individuals will be able to hear firsthand the safety considerations that went into the critical decision making regarding the vaccine.

There are two major committees that need to be involved in this process: The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which consists of experts in a variety of fields who can help in evaluating data to determine whether the vaccines should be approved for public use; and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which makes recommendations for vaccine use once the FDA has approved the vaccine. Information on the ACIP and the ability to listen and provide comments at meetings can be found online

The right message, the right messenger, the right communication channel

To be sure, there is still work to be done to make sure the current vaccine candidates meet US standards. There are many questions that are not yet answered by the early data made public. But the past weeks have been a major step in the right direction; we now have proof of principle -- that Covid-19 can be prevented by a vaccine. And the reported data suggest the vaccines are relatively safe.

Fortunately, there are many more vaccines in clinical trials, so we may eventually have choices of vaccines and assure supplies are available to vaccinate large proportions of the population to induce both individual and community protection. But at the end of the day, vaccines don't save lives. Vaccinations save lives. A vaccine dose that remains in the vial is 0% effective regardless of the results of the clinical trials.

Therefore, it is critical to assure the public that the vaccine benefits far exceed any risks. To do that, we need the right message, delivered by the right messenger through the right communications channel.

What is particularly important is that the messengers have the trust of the public. Whether it is Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx or any other health official who becomes a household name as we get closer to a vaccine's rollout, they must speak honestly in terms the public can understand, and deliver the message through trusted channels, such as national and local news outlets.

It will also be important for national health officials to provide critical information to primary care providers to help them in discussing risks and benefits with their patients, as these physicians are often the most trusted sources of information.

With rampant misinformation proliferating on social media, it is incumbent upon health officials at all levels to be intentional and transparent with the information they share about these vaccines. Only then, with the trust of the public and a widespread vaccination effort underway, can we embark upon the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic.How to instill public confidence in a Covid-19 vaccineFew measures in preventive medicine can compare with the impact of vaccines.

Dolly Parton: Singer, Songwriter, Pandemic Savior?Ms. Parton donated $1 million to fund research for a coronavirus vaccine. After a promising announcement from a major drugmaker on Monday, fans are crediting her with helping to save the world from the virus.She wrote “I Will Always Love You” and “Jolene” on the same day and built a theme park around herself. She has given memorable onscreen performances as a wisecracking hairstylist and harassed secretary. She even helped bring about the creation of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”

Now, Dolly Parton’s fans are crediting her with saving the world from the coronavirus. It’s an exaggerated, tongue-in-cheek claim, to be sure. But for legions of admirers, Ms. Parton’s donation this spring to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which worked with the drugmaker Moderna to develop a coronavirus vaccine, was another example of how her generosity and philanthropy have made her one of the world’s most beloved artists.

“Shakespeare may have written King Lear during the plague, but Dolly Parton funded a Covid vaccine, dropped a Christmas album and a Christmas special,” the author Lyz Lenz said on Twitter.

In April, Ms. Parton announced that she had donated $1 million to Vanderbilt after her friend Dr. Naji Abumrad, a professor of surgery at the university, in Nashville, told her about the work researchers were doing to come up with a vaccine. (Dr. Abumrad’s son, Jad Abumrad, is the creator of “Radiolab” and the host of the podcast “Dolly Parton’s America.”)Dolly Parton: Singer, Songwriter, Pandemic Savior?Ms. Parton donated $1 million to fund research for a coronavirus vaccine.

Why It's a Big Deal If the First Covid Vaccine Is 'Genetic'If approved by the FDA, Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine would be the first of its kind, setting a record for speed—but raising questions about distribution.On Monday morning, when representatives from the drug company Pfizer said that its Covid-19 vaccine appears to be more than 90 percent effective, stocks soared, White House officials rushed to (falsely) claim credit, and sighs of relief went up all around the internet. “Dear World. We have a vaccine! Best news since January 10,” tweeted Florian Krammer, a virologist and vaccinologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (who also happens to be a participant in the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trial).

Everything You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy.

But having a press release from a pharmaceutical company saying a vaccine works is very different from actually having a vaccine that works. Pfizer, and its German partner on the vaccine, BioNTech, have yet to release any data from their Phase III trial. The findings this week are based on the trial’s first interim analysis, conducted by an outside panel of experts after 94 of the 43,538 participants contracted the coronavirus. That analysis suggests that most of the people who became ill had received a placebo, instead of the vaccine. But it doesn’t say much beyond that. (More on why that matters, later.)

And logistically, there’s still a lot that has to happen before people who aren’t study subjects can start rolling up their sleeves. Pfizer researchers are now collecting at least two months’ worth of safety follow-up data. If those findings raise no red flags, the company could then apply for an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Only then could execs start doling out the 50 million or so doses they expect to make by the end of the year, a process complicated by the fact that until it’s ready to be shot into someone’s arm, Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept at temperatures downwards of -80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is way colder than the usual vaccine cold chain. Completing the immunization also requires two doses given three weeks apart. Oh yeah, and states that at this moment are trying to do all the other things you have to do to prepare for such a complicated immunization push—hiring vaccinators, setting up digital registries, deciding who will get vaccine priority—are doing so without any extra money dedicated to the effort.

Those are a lot of caveats. But still, there’s reason to be hopeful. If the results hold up, a Covid-19 vaccine that’s 90 percent effective will have vastly exceeded the efficacy bar set by the FDA. That level of protection would put it up there with the measles shot, one of the most potent vaccines developed to date.

The arrival of an effective vaccine to fight SARS-CoV-2 less than a year after the novel coronavirus emerged would smash every record ever set by vaccine makers. “Historic isn’t even the right word,” says Larry Corey of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. A renowned virologist, Corey has spent the last three decades leading the search for a vaccine against the virus that causes AIDS. He’s never seen an inoculation developed for a new bug in under five years, let alone one. “It’s never happened before, never, not even close,” he says. “It’s just an amazing accomplishment of science.”

And perhaps even more monumental is the kind of vaccine that Pfizer and BioNTech are bringing across the finish line. The active ingredient inside their shot is mRNA—mobile strings of genetic code that contain the blueprints for proteins. Cells use mRNA to get those specs out of hard DNA storage and into their protein-making factories. The mRNA inside Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine directs any cells it reaches to run a coronavirus spike-building program. The viral proteins these cells produce can’t infect any other cells, but they are foreign enough to trip the body’s defense systems. They also look enough like the real virus to train the immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2, should its owner encounter the infectious virus in the future. Up until now, this technology has never been approved for use in people. A successful mRNA vaccine won’t just be a triumph over the new coronavirus, it’ll be a huge leap forward for the science of vaccine making.Why It's a Big Deal If the First Covid Vaccine Is 'Genetic'If approved by the FDA, Pfizer and BioNTech's mRNA vaccine would be the first of its kind, setting a record for speed—but raising questions about distribution.On Monday morning, when representatives from the drug company Pfizer said that its Covid-19 vaccine appears to be more than 90 percent effective, stocks soared, White House officials rushed to (falsely) claim credit, and sighs of relief went up all around the internet. “Dear World. We have a vaccine! Best news since January 10,” tweeted Florian Krammer, a virologist and vaccinologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (who also happens to be a participant in the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trial).

Everything You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy.

But having a press release from a pharmaceutical company saying a vaccine works is very different from actually having a vaccine that works. Pfizer, and its German partner on the vaccine, BioNTech, have yet to release any data from their Phase III trial. The findings this week are based on the trial’s first interim analysis, conducted by an outside panel of experts after 94 of the 43,538 participants contracted the coronavirus. That analysis suggests that most of the people who became ill had received a placebo, instead of the vaccine. But it doesn’t say much beyond that. (More on why that matters, later.)

And logistically, there’s still a lot that has to happen before people who aren’t study subjects can start rolling up their sleeves. Pfizer researchers are now collecting at least two months’ worth of safety follow-up data. If those findings raise no red flags, the company could then apply for an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Only then could execs start doling out the 50 million or so doses they expect to make by the end of the year, a process complicated by the fact that until it’s ready to be shot into someone’s arm, Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept at temperatures downwards of -80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is way colder than the usual vaccine cold chain. Completing the immunization also requires two doses given three weeks apart. Oh yeah, and states that at this moment are trying to do all the other things you have to do to prepare for such a complicated immunization push—hiring vaccinators, setting up digital registries, deciding who will get vaccine priority—are doing so without any extra money dedicated to the effort.

Those are a lot of caveats. But still, there’s reason to be hopeful. If the results hold up, a Covid-19 vaccine that’s 90 percent effective will have vastly exceeded the efficacy bar set by the FDA. That level of protection would put it up there with the measles shot, one of the most potent vaccines developed to date.

It’s a dark and alarming time in the struggle against the coronavirus, particularly in the United States, where hospitalizations and daily infections have surged.

But amid the gloom comes some light: A trial by the drug maker Pfizer has returned preliminary results suggesting that its vaccine is 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19.

Even more promising, the timeline — contingent on benchmarks being reached and approval being granted — is quite short. There could be enough of the vaccine for 20 million Americans by January.

Headlines

Pfizer may soon have a vaccine—but challenges lie ahead

Pfizer and BioNTech put out a press release this week announcing that its Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90 percent effective for participants who were definitely Covid-free before the trial started then developed symptomatic cases. So far, there have been no serious safety concerns. The first of its kind, this vaccine is made up of mRNA that helps the body make proteins that train the immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2. Pfizer will likely have the safety data it needs to apply for FDA approval by the end of the month. If it’s greenlit, it will be the first mRNA vaccine cleared for use in humans. Moderna, which is also making an mRNA vaccine, is expected to release early data in the coming days as well.

Though an approved vaccine would be exciting, distributing the Pfizer shot comes with its share of logistical problems. It requires two doses and must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit or -70 degrees Celcius in order to be effective, which will make distribution across the US—not to mention worldwide—difficult and complicated. Then there’s the fraught question of who should get it first. Regardless, inoculating the whole world will require more than Pfizer’s vaccine alone.

Biden plans his coronavirus response as a new outbreak hits the Trump administration

Earlier this week, Joe Biden announced the members of his coronavirus task force. The 13-member team of doctors and health experts will help the president-elect develop a plan for tackling the pandemic and work with governors to develop consistent messaging at the state and federal levels. Separately, he is also forming a special transition team for coordinating the Biden White House’s coronavirus response with other federal agencies. Yesterday Biden also joined Democratic legislators in demanding a new stimulus package before the end of 2020.

Meanwhile, yet another coronavirus outbreak has hit the White House, likely after a crowded party on election night. Mark Meadows, the president’s chief of staff, and campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski are among those who have tested positive. More than 130 Secret Service officers who protect the president and the White House have recently been ordered to isolate or quarantine as well.

As people migrate indoors, cases rise in record numbers

As winter approaches, the pandemic continues to accelerate at an alarming rate: It has been just over a week since cases in the US first topped 100,000, and yesterday there were more than 160,000. In response, governors in Ohio and Utah have instituted mask mandates, and those in Illinois, Maryland, and Washington have raised the possibility of reinstating stricter lockdowns. And with the holidays just a few weeks away, experts are emphasizing that there is no way to travel and gather with family that is completely risk-free.

Part of the problem is that people are more likely to gather indoors as the weather cools and daylight hours wane. New research found that crowded indoor venues may have accounted for eight in 10 new cases in the early months of the pandemic. How can we make our indoor spaces safer? Given that viruses have an easier time spreading through dry air, researchers are investigating whether humidifiers could help keep Covid-19 at bay inside. Questions about air quality and flow could create the opportunity to transform how we ventilate buildings for the better.

Proning, an emergency medical procedure, entails flipping people over onto their stomachs.

It hasn’t been the subject of much research or attention, in part because it’s so simple it almost seems a misnomer to call it a “medical procedure.” But it’s become much more widespread since the spring, and some experts say this could be part of the reason why we’re seeing fewer deaths even as cases rise.

Pfizer says early analysis shows its Covid-19 vaccine is 90% effectiveDrugmaker Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected efficacy if the trend continues.(CNN) Drugmaker Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected efficacy if the trend continues.

The so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.

Pfizer said that the vaccine, made with German partner BioNTech, had an efficacy rate higher than 90% at seven days after the second dose, which means protection is achieved 28 days after a person begins vaccination. The vaccine requires two doses. The US Food and Drug Administration has said it would expect at least 50% efficacy from any coronavirus vaccine.

In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Monday morning, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla called the Covid-19 vaccine "the greatest medical advance" in the world's last hundred years.

"Emotions are very high. You can imagine how I felt when I heard the results yesterday at 2 p.m. I think that likely, based on impact, this will be the greatest medical advance in the last 100 years," Bourla said.

A Washington TragedyHundreds of thousands of Americans have died. Coronavirus cases are surging again. There’s still no federal plan.Our graphics department even debuted a new color — a dark purplish red — on The New York Times’s online coronavirus case map to capture the record rates of infection.

Yet, in the face of this entirely anticipated crisis, Washington is doing very little. After so many months of this tragedy, there is still no coordinated federal response to the virus.

“The general strategy is abdication,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University, who says it’s possible that as many as 300,000 more Americans could die of the virus before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. “There are going to be a lot of unnecessary deaths, a lot of unnecessary cases of Covid that didn’t need to happen.”

There are no signs of any change in strategy coming from the current administration.

President Trump is more focused on litigating a settled election than combating the virus. Since Election Day, he’s held one public event — an update on his administration’s effort to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine. Other than traveling to his golf course, the president has remained holed up inside the White House.

At the same time, the government he leads has been offering mixed messages.

On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans avoid traveling and gathering with relatives for the Thanksgiving holiday. And later in the day the White House coronavirus task force held its first news conference in months, urging Americans to remain vigilant as they wait for a vaccine. But on Wednesday, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called some local guidelines limiting Thanksgiving gatherings “Orwellian.” (States that have imposed fewer virus containment measures now have the worst outbreaks, according to a New York Times analysis.)A Washington TragedyHundreds of thousands of Americans have died.

Next crop of COVID-19 vaccine developers take more traditional route - Reuters CanadaThe handful of drugmakers dominating the global coronavirus vaccine race are pushing the boundaries of vaccine technology. The next crop under development feature more conventional, proven designs.CHICAGO/BERLIN (Reuters) - The handful of drugmakers dominating the global coronavirus vaccine race are pushing the boundaries of vaccine technology. The next crop under development feature more conventional, proven designs.

The world will need several different vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, given the sheer size of global need, variations in effects on different populations, and possible limits of effectiveness in the first crop.

Many leading candidates now in final-stage testing are based on new, largely unproven technology platforms designed to produce vaccines at speed. They include messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used by Moderna Inc MRNA.O and Pfizer Inc PFE.N with partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F, and inactivated cold virus platforms used by Oxford University/AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and CanSino Biologics 6185.HK, whose vaccine has been approved for military use in China.

Merck & Co MRK.N in September started testing a COVID-19 vaccine based on a weakened measles virus that delivers genes from the new coronavirus into the body to stimulate an immune response to the coronavirus.

Of these, only the technology offered by J&J and CanSino that use cold viruses as vectors to deliver coronavirus genetic material have ever produced a licensed vaccine - for Ebola.

The next set of candidates - with late-stage trial results expected in the first half of 2021 - are heavily skewed toward approaches that have produced successful vaccines.

Conventional methods include using a killed or inactivated version of the pathogen that causes a disease to provoke an immune response, such as those used to make flu, polio and rabies vaccines.

Also more common are protein-based vaccines that use purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response. Vaccines against whooping cough, or pertussis, and shingles employ this approach.

French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA is developing a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine employing the same approach it uses for its Flublok seasonal flu vaccine. Sanofi expects to start the final phase of testing in early December, with approval targeted in the first half of 2021.

While Novavax Inc NVAX.O has not yet produced a licensed vaccine, it is using similar purified protein technology and expects to start a late-stage U.S. trial involving 30,000 volunteers in late November.

“Those are more traditional approaches, so we can feel more comfortable that we have a lot of experience with them,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Offit also sees promise in some of the inactivated virus vaccines being developed by Chinese researchers, including Sinopharm’s China National Biotec Group (CNBG), one of the few first-crop developers using a traditional technique.

Other second-wave developers are making vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which mimic the structure of the coronavirus but contain no genetic material from it.

VLP vaccines can be produced in a variety of different types of cells, including mammal, bacterial, insect, yeast and plant cells. This approach has been used to develop vaccines for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus.

Quebec's Medicago is testing a VLP COVID-19 vaccine grown in tobacco plants with the backing of tobacco company Philip Morris PM.N.

Medicago has yet to produce an approved vaccine, but has completed large-scale testing for a seasonal flu vaccine using this approach. It plans to begin mid-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine next month and aims to make up to 1 billion doses a year by 2023.

Others are looking at alternative delivery methods, such as the nasal spray vaccine being developed by a team at Xiamen University, Hong Kong University and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which is based on a modified flu virus.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

The second crop, however, could face problems completing large studies if the current leaders bring their vaccines over the finish line in the coming months.

“If we get a super vaccine in December, from company x, which is on the market, it will be difficult to recruit participants into other studies,” said Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.

"Then everyone will say, if the vaccine exists, I will get vaccinated now with this vaccine. This will definitely prove a problem for recruitment,” added Kremsner, who is testing CureVac's CVAC.O mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in early clinical trials with backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

On the flip side, it is easier and faster to prove efficacy when community spread of the virus is rampant as is happening again in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, a potential advantage for companies starting large-scale vaccine trials in the near future.Next crop of COVID-19 vaccine developers take more traditional route - Reuters CanadaThe handful of drugmakers dominating the global coronavirus vaccine race are pushing the boundaries of vaccine technology.

Also more common are protein-based vaccines that use purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response. Vaccines against whooping cough, or pertussis, and shingles employ this approach.

French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA is developing a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine employing the same approach it uses for its Flublok seasonal flu vaccine. Sanofi expects to start the final phase of testing in early December, with approval targeted in the first half of 2021.

While Novavax Inc NVAX.O has not yet produced a licensed vaccine, it is using similar purified protein technology and expects to start a late-stage U.S. trial involving 30,000 volunteers in late November.

“Those are more traditional approaches, so we can feel more comfortable that we have a lot of experience with them,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Offit also sees promise in some of the inactivated virus vaccines being developed by Chinese researchers, including Sinopharm’s China National Biotec Group (CNBG), one of the few first-crop developers using a traditional technique.

Other second-wave developers are making vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which mimic the structure of the coronavirus but contain no genetic material from it.

VLP vaccines can be produced in a variety of different types of cells, including mammal, bacterial, insect, yeast and plant cells. This approach has been used to develop vaccines for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus.

Quebec's Medicago is testing a VLP COVID-19 vaccine grown in tobacco plants with the backing of tobacco company Philip Morris PM.N.

Medicago has yet to produce an approved vaccine, but has completed large-scale testing for a seasonal flu vaccine using this approach. It plans to begin mid-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine next month and aims to make up to 1 billion doses a year by 2023.

Others are looking at alternative delivery methods, such as the nasal spray vaccine being developed by a team at Xiamen University, Hong Kong University and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which is based on a modified flu virus.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

The second crop, however, could face problems completing large studies if the current leaders bring their vaccines over the finish line in the coming months.

“If we get a super vaccine in December, from company x, which is on the market, it will be difficult to recruit participants into other studies,” said Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.

"Then everyone will say, if the vaccine exists, I will get vaccinated now with this vaccine. This will definitely prove a problem for recruitment,” added Kremsner, who is testing CureVac's CVAC.O mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in early clinical trials with backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

On the flip side, it is easier and faster to prove efficacy when community spread of the virus is rampant as is happening again in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, a potential advantage for companies starting large-scale vaccine trials in the near future.



Pfizer has enough safety data about its coronavirus vaccine and is preparing to submit for FDA authorization, CEO saysPfizer has accumulated enough safety data on its Covid-19 vaccine and is preparing to file for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, company CEO Albert Bourla said Tuesday.(CNN) Pfizer has accumulated enough safety data on its Covid-19 vaccine and is preparing to file for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, company CEO Albert Bourla said Tuesday.

Last week, the company released early clinical trial data showing its vaccine is more than 90% effective, and said it was waiting to apply to the FDA until it had gathered sufficient data on the safety of the vaccine.

"I think the questions about the safety at large also have been answered," Bourla said in an interview hosted by The New York Times on Tuesday. "Our safety milestone has been achieved already, and we are preparing now for submissions."

Moderna, another pharmaceutical company, announced Monday that early results from their clinical trials show their vaccine is 94.5% effective. The company plans to apply to the FDA for authorization soon after it accumulates more safety data later this month.

There’s never been a more joyous time to watch tech stock prices fall. As markets opened on Monday, Pfizer shared the news that a trial of its coronavirus vaccine had shown it to be 90 percent effective. American markets soared to all-time highs while many stocks that benefit from the public being holed up in quarantine are now taking a hit—chief among them: Zoom.

Tech stocks have been some of the biggest market winners since the covid-19 pandemic has kept people indoors and socially isolated. But analysts have warned for months that the wild ride could end as lockdowns are lifted among the distribution of a vaccine. It appears we might be seeing some of the first inklings of that shift this morning. Here’s a selection of how some quarantine-friendly companies’ stock prices were doing within the last couple of hours:

Zoom - down over 15% Etsy - down around 18% Netflix - down over 7% PayPal - down over 6% Take-Two Interactive - down around 9% Activision - down close to 6% Peloton - down more than 20%

Some of these stocks, like Etsy, have recovered some of their losses since the morning bell, but others, like Peloton, have continued to see their market value fall.

Zoom is probably the company with the most on the line right now. The video chat service became a phenomenon as lockdowns took hold and it saw its revenue spike by 169% in June. In general, the growth in userbase and the unexpected cash-influx should leave Zoom better-positioned than it’s ever been if the day comes when the pandemic has been contained. But at the same time, its competitors are some of the most powerful tech firms in the world.

A company like PayPal is used to ups-and-downs. And Netflix should be fine, though everyone in the streaming business will be facing troubles for the foreseeable future as the well of content that’s completed production continues to run dry.

The prospect of some kind of hope for the future feels good, but the markets have been optimistic since it first began to look like Joe Biden would win the White House last week. Pfizer’s positive outlook for its vaccine is likely just feeding into that overall feeling of greater stability—there’s still a long way to go. A peer-review of the data from the Pfizer vaccine trial has not been published yet, but scientists told the New York Times that the initial data is encouraging and exceeded their expectations of effectiveness.

Still nursing their wounds from their loss in the p residential e lection, Trump-world is by turns salty and elated by the vaccine news. Donald Trump Jr. implied on Twitter that today’s announcement is all part of a conspiracy to harm his father. Smarter former and current figures from the administration like Nikki Haley and Mike Pence credited the public-private partnership approach of “Operation Warp Speed” for making the new vaccine data possible.

But Kathrin Jansen, a senior vice president and the head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, made it clear to the Times that Operation Warp Speed provided no money for the development of the vaccine and sought to distance the company from government programs. In general, Pfizer has subtly and not-so-subtly made it known that it fears President Trump’s rhetoric on vaccines could harm public confidence in a vaccine. In October, Gallup found that only 50% of American respondents would be willing to take a vaccine if it were ready now.

President-elect Biden released a statement this morning congratulating the men and women at Pfizer on their hopeful steps toward a vaccine. But Biden warned that an end to the pandemic is still months away and noted that even after a vaccine is approved it will still take months to distribute.

With Winter Coming and Trump Still in Charge, Virus Experts Fear the WorstRegardless of the election results, President Trump will be the one directing the government’s coronavirus response as infections climb and winter approaches.WASHINGTON — Regardless of the election’s outcome this week, President Trump will be the one steering the country through what is likely to be the darkest and potentially deadliest period of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has largely excluded the nation’s leading health experts from his inner circle.

Mr. Trump will still have control of the nation’s health apparatus and the bully pulpit that comes with the Oval Office until Jan. 20, as infections approach 100,000 a day and death rates begin to rise as hospitals are strained to their breaking points.

But the president has largely shuttered the White House Coronavirus Task Force and doubled down on anti-science language, telling voters that the country is “rounding the corner” in the fight against the virus that has claimed nearly a quarter of a million lives.

He has stopped listening to Alex M. Azar II, his health secretary; Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general. On Monday, the president lashed out at Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s leading infectious disease specialist, hinting that he may fire Dr. Fauci after the election — though it would be extremely difficult for him to do so.With Winter Coming and Trump Still in Charge, Virus Experts Fear the WorstRegardless of the election results, President Trump will be the one directing the government’s coronavirus response as infections climb and winter approaches.WASHINGTON — Regardless of the election’s outcome this week, President Trump will be the one steering the country through what is likely to be the darkest and potentially deadliest period of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has largely excluded the nation’s leading health experts from his inner circle.

Trudeau urges Canadians to 'hang on' after coronavirus vaccine news - Reuters IndiaTrudeau urges Canadians to 'hang on' after coronavirus vaccine news  Reuters IndiaSlideshow ( 2 images )

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s announcement that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective is “very encouraging” and Canada is looking to secure more doses of it, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.

“We hope a vaccine is coming early next year. We’re seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,” he told a news conference. Canada has a deal with Pfizer for a minimum of 20 million doses.

The doses could be distributed during the first quarter of next year to high priority groups, Trudeau said. Canada may get the vaccine after the United States and Britain, but at about the same time as the European Union and others, a government source said.

While Trudeau said other vaccine candidates are expected to perform well, he said Canada was looking to secure more doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE.

“As for Pfizer, I know we have secured several million doses ... and obviously if it works we will buy more when they become available,” he said. Trudeau added that there were logistical challenges to distributing the vaccine since it must be stored at very low temperatures.

“We don’t have the infrastructure in place now to store the vaccine but I’m confident it will be in place in January,” said the government source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. “We won’t be able to get supplies into every pharmacy, certainly not immediately.”

As is the case in many countries, a second wave of the novel coronavirus is sweeping across Canada, which is setting daily records for new infections. Canada has recorded 264,113 cases and 10,522 deaths so far, forcing some provinces to reimpose restrictions on gatherings and movement.

“We need to hang on - the next months are critical,” Trudeau said. Canada has agreements with a number of major companies to access up to 358 million doses of their vaccine candidates.Trudeau urges Canadians to 'hang on' after coronavirus vaccine news - Reuters IndiaTrudeau urges Canadians to 'hang on' after coronavirus vaccine news  Reuters IndiaSlideshow ( 2 images )

US STOCKS-Wall Street rallies on coronavirus vaccine trial results - Reuters UKUS STOCKS-Wall Street rallies on coronavirus vaccine trial results  Reuters UKNEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow rallied sharply but closed shy of their records on Monday as investors bet that a full economic reopening was finally in sight following the first positive data from a late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial.

U.S. crude oil rose more than 8% and pushed up energy stocks while safe-haven U.S. Treasuries sold off after U.S. drugmaker Pfizer PFE.N and its German partner BioNTech BNTX.O said a large-scale trial of their vaccine showed it was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.

Investors said they were also reassured by Saturday’s news that Joe Biden had garnered enough votes to win the U.S. presidential election as they had priced in this news last week.

“Election uncertainty is fading into the rearview mirror. Now we have this boost of investor enthusiasm after the vaccine news,” said to Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “All the types of companies that would benefit from us returning to a pre-COVID world are the big winners today.”

Sectors such as energy, travel and financials which were among the hardest hit by lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus were some of the biggest percentage gainers on Monday.

While their vaccine study is still ongoing and requires approval, Pfizer and BioNTech said they had found no serious safety concerns so far and expected to seek U.S. emergency use authorization later this month.

“It’s not that we’re out of the woods with COVID. It’s that the vaccine starts to remove the worst case scenario that we surge out of control and go back into a national lockdown,” said Antonelli. “The market’s looking into the future, to the first and second quarter of next year.”

However the S&P pared some gains late in the session. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said President Donald Trump was completely within his rights to look into “irregularities” from last week’s election.

Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, pinned the late session fading on “profit-taking” after the morning rally.

Brazil's Bolsonaro says cure, not vaccine, way out of coronavirus crisis - ReutersBrazil's Bolsonaro says cure, not vaccine, way out of coronavirus crisis  ReutersBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday it would be easier and cheaper to invest in a cure for Covid-19 rather than a vaccine, in a clear sign the president is increasingly positioning himself against inoculation programs.

“I’ll give my personal opinion: Isn’t it cheaper and easier to invest in a cure rather than a vaccine?” Bolsonaro told supporters outside the presidential palace in Brasilia.

Bolsonaro, who caught and recovered from, Covid-19 in July, has repeatedly downplayed the gravity of the virus and continues to promote the anti-malarial chloroquine as a cure despite mounting evidence it doesn’t work.

In Brazil, more than 150,000 people have died due to COVID-19, the world’s second highest death toll behind the United States.

Chloroquine was also heralded by U.S. President Donald Trump but has dropped far down the list of potential global treatments for the novel coronavirus as repeated scientific studies failed to find any significant evidence of its effectiveness.

“I’m an example, I took chloroquine, others took invermectin, others took Annita,” Bolsonaro said also referring to two broad-spectrum anti-parasite drugs.

“Everything indicates that everyone that took one of these three alternatives early on was cured,” he added without providing any scientific evidence to support his statement.

None of the drugs mentioned by Bolsonaro have been proven to work and none are authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 in Europe, for example.

Bolsonaro’s comments come as a political battle heats up between the president and Joao Doria, the governor of Sao Paulo - Brazil’s most populous and economically advanced state.

Doria, who is widely expected to run against Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential elections, has positioned his state to get early access to China’s Sinovac vaccine which he plans to roll out in a mass inoculation plan by mid-December.

Bolsonaro last week said the federal government would not buy the Chinese vaccine, contradicting his own health minister who had said the drug would be part of the country’s immunization plan.

Bolsonaro, who caught and recovered from, Covid-19 in July, has repeatedly downplayed the gravity of the virus and continues to promote the anti-malarial chloroquine as a cure despite mounting evidence it doesn’t work.

In Brazil, more than 150,000 people have died due to COVID-19, the world’s second highest death toll behind the United States.

Chloroquine was also heralded by U.S. President Donald Trump but has dropped far down the list of potential global treatments for the novel coronavirus as repeated scientific studies failed to find any significant evidence of its effectiveness.

“I’m an example, I took chloroquine, others took invermectin, others took Annita,” Bolsonaro said also referring to two broad-spectrum anti-parasite drugs.

“Everything indicates that everyone that took one of these three alternatives early on was cured,” he added without providing any scientific evidence to support his statement.

None of the drugs mentioned by Bolsonaro have been proven to work and none are authorized for the treatment of COVID-19 in Europe, for example.

Bolsonaro’s comments come as a political battle heats up between the president and Joao Doria, the governor of Sao Paulo - Brazil’s most populous and economically advanced state.

Doria, who is widely expected to run against Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential elections, has positioned his state to get early access to China’s Sinovac vaccine which he plans to roll out in a mass inoculation plan by mid-December.

Bolsonaro last week said the federal government would not buy the Chinese vaccine, contradicting his own health minister who had said the drug would be part of the country’s immunization plan. [nL1N2HC0MW]



Instant View: AstraZeneca says its coronavirus vaccine is around 90% effective - ReutersInstant View: AstraZeneca says its coronavirus vaccine is around 90% effective  Reuters(Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday its vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be around 90% effective without any serious side effects, giving the world another important tool to halt the COVID-19 pandemic.

Phase III trial results of the vaccine developed by Oxford University found it was 90% effective if administered at a half dose and then at a full dose, or 62% effective if administered in two full doses.

But scientists cautioned against seeing this as evidence that it would be less useful than rival vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which each prevented about 95% of cases according to data this month.

Here are some reactions to the news:

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON

“Incredibly exciting news the Oxford vaccine has proved so effective in trials,” Johnson said on Twitter. “There are still further safety checks ahead, but these are fantastic results.”

BRITISH HEALTH SECRETARY MATT HANCOCK

“We hope to be able to start vaccinating next month,” Hancock told BBC TV.

“The bulk of the vaccine rollout programme will be in January, February, March. And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal.”

He earlier told Sky News: “We’ve got 100 million doses on order and should all that go well, the bulk of the rollout will be in the new year.”

Hancock also said there was evidence in the report that the vaccine could reduce transmission of the disease.

“Now of course that would be very good news if confirmed, because obviously what we want to do is not only stop people from getting the disease but also stop its transmission,” he said.

PROFESSOR ANDREW POLLARD, DIRECTOR OF THE OXFORD VACCINE GROUP AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR OF THE OXFORD VACCINE TRIAL

“That 90% is an intriguing result. So when we give a half dose as the first dose (it) means that we’ve got more vaccine available. And then... after the second dose we see 90% protection,” Pollard told BBC TV.

He said earlier: “We also have a vaccine that is going to be easy to distribute if stored at fridge temperatures, and we can get it to every corner in the world. It’s already been manufactured in 10 different sites around the world to make sure that that can happen.”

HARGREAVES ANALYST SUSANNAH STREETER

“There was little...enthusiasm for AstraZeneca this morning, as the efficacy rates for its vaccine fell short of rivals,” Hargreaves analyst Susannah Streeter said as the company’s shares fell as much as 2% in early trade.

PETER LIESE, EU LAWMAKER WITH THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE’S PARTY

“The efficacy seems to be lower than with BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna but the vaccine still has advantages. AstraZeneca uses a well-known technology, namely a so-called vector vaccine.

“Although I have great confidence in the projects of BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, it is nevertheless good that we also have a vaccine candidate that uses a different technique. It may be that the AstraZeneca vaccine is more suitable for certain groups of people and it would certainly be an alternative for people who do not accept the novel m-RNA vaccines. Another advantage is that the vaccine is significantly cheaper than BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.”

JEAN-DANIEL LELIEVRE, HEAD OF CLINIC IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT CRETEIL HENRI-MONDOR HOSPITAL, FRANCE

“We are only seeing partial results here and we would need to know the exact number of subjects for each regimen. The trial also had to be stopped and AstraZeneca makes no mention of the incident in today’s release.

“Given that we are looking at a vaccine using a viral vector, we could potentially see an interference taking place with antibodies reacting to the vector and not to the virus. There are lots of small points for which we need more granular information to understand how this vaccine differs, in terms of efficacy, from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.”

PASCAL SORIOT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASTRAZENECA

“The vaccine’s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval.”

PAM CHENG, OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE, ASTRAZENECA

AstraZeneca will have 200 million doses of its candidate vaccine by the end of 2020, with 700 million doses ready globally by the end of the first quarter of 2021, operations executive Pam Cheng said.

Cheng told a briefing that there would be 20 million doses in Britain by the end of the year, with 70 million doses for the UK by the end of Q1 2021.

PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD:

“The reported efficacy of 70% is an interim measure and as more data accrue we will get a better idea of the protection it affords. Importantly, from what we have heard the vaccine seems to prevent infection not just disease. This is important as the vaccine could reduce the spread of the virus as well as protect the vulnerable from severe disease.

The Oxford vaccine can be stored in the fridge, as opposed to the freezer like the other two vaccines, which means it is a more practical solution for use worldwide.”

MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON

“These results are intriguing, with two different estimates of efficacy depending upon the dose used with the vaccine.

“These are provisional results that have not been peer-reviewed and the study is ongoing, so as with the other recent announcements from Pfizer and Moderna, we should be a little cautious about these findings. It’s not yet fully clear why a half dose and then a full dose was potentially more protective but if the final results continue to show this pattern of around 90% effectiveness, this would allow greater vaccine supply not just in the UK but also globally.”

DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE, LONDON

“I think it is a real fool’s errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of phase 3 data from press releases. For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we’ll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we’ll be a lot happier.”Instant View: AstraZeneca says its coronavirus vaccine is around 90% effective - ReutersInstant View: AstraZeneca says its coronavirus vaccine is around 90% effective  Reuters(Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday its vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be around 90% effective without any serious side effects, giving the world another important tool to halt the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the meantime, U.S. pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co. has developed an experimental antibody that could at least help treat patients exhibiting mild symptoms, preventing them from worsening to the point they need hospitalisation.

Authorised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the treatment is a hopeful step forward in the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. This is exciting enough, but what has really caught Twitter's attention is the medicine's delightful name: bamlanivimab.

As many on the internet have noted, it looks a lot like a well-known earworm from African-American work song "Black Betty," popularised through covers by Ram Jam and Spiderbait.

But there was one thing he did not see coming: the conspiracy theories swirling around the coronavirus epidemic, and the fact that he would be at the center of many of them.

While giving an interview at the virtual health conference STAT Summit on Tuesday, Gates repeatedly skirted questions about how the anti-science messages of the Trump administration were affecting the coronavirus response. One question he did answer was whether he and America's reassuringly straight-talking grandpa — Dr. Anthony Fauci — ever commiserated about the prevalence of conspiracy theories. Especially those concerning, well, them.

Gates shared that he was taken aback.

"The idea of these conspiracies — What is the purpose of the vaccine? Is it microchipping, population control? — that was so unexpected that I don't think either Tony or I had great advice for each other, other than, hey, keep on giving that fact-based message," Gates said.

A new analysis of COVID-19 misinformation, based on a representative sample of 1,040 U.S. adults, found that 13 percent of Americans believe the conspiracy theory claiming "Bill Gates is behind the coronavirus pandemic." The report, published in the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review, also found 25 percent believe that "the coronavirus is being used to force a dangerous and unnecessary vaccine on Americans."

Those numbers and the general rise of conspiracy theories are certainly depressing. But at least Tony and Bill can talk it out with each other.Bill Gates was not expecting all the unhinged COVID-19 conspiracy theoriesAfter warning about the dangers of a pandemic for years, Bill Gates looks like the most prescient man in America.

US hits highest 7-day average of coronavirus cases since the pandemic beganThe latest surge of Covid-19 infections has brought the seven-day average of new daily cases to heights not seen since the pandemic began.(CNN) The country is facing another cycle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it may be the hardest yet, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Monday.

"I think we're right now at the cusp of what's going to be exponential spread in parts of the country," Gottlieb said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

"If we took aggressive steps right now, we could potentially forestall the worst of it, but we're not going to do that," because there's a lot of fatigue and "policy resistance to taking strong action," he said.

"We really have two or three months of the acute phase of this pandemic to get through," he said. "This is going to be the hardest phase, probably."

Worst number of cases yet

That's as the country continues to report the most number of cases we've seen to date. The seven-day average of daily new cases reached an all-time high of 68,767 on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous record of 67,293 was set July 22.

"Unfortunately, I think the statement about 'new record' is going to be repeated over and over again in the days and weeks to come," said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.

"I expect that those numbers will continue to climb. Hospitalizations are going to continue to climb."

The abysmal week was marked by the two worst days of daily new cases reported since the pandemic began. More than 83,000 new cases were reported both Friday and Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins.

To be clear: This surge reflects an onslaught of new infections -- not just increased testing, contrary to what skeptics claim.

"You know why we have cases? Because we test so much," President Donald Trump claimed at a rally Saturday in North Carolina. "And in many ways, it's good. And in many ways, it's foolish."

But the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has soared 23% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins data. The seven-day average of new tests performed has risen only 2.87% over the past week, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

And we are long past the point of just urban, heavily populated areas being the only places hit hard. South Dakota's test positivity rate is 23%, the state's health department said Monday. That means of every 100 people tested, 23 have been infected. The World Health Organization in May advised governments not to reopen until test positivity rates were 5% or lower for at least 14 days.

States to receive 36.7 million rapid tests

The federal government is shipping 36.7 million rapid Covid-19 tests, and states should be receiving them by the end of the week, the US Department of Health and Human Services told CNN Monday.

The tests are intended to help states with reopening, according to an HHS news release.

"To protect seniors and to facilitate the continued re-opening of schools, businesses and the economy, the Trump Administration prioritized scaling-up our state and national point of care testing capacity," Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir, the department's assistant secretary for health, said in a news release Sunday.

President Donald Trump last month announced a plan to send 150 million BinaxNOW Covid-19 tests nationally. HHS on Monday confirmed that this week's shipments are part of that total.

"Combining personal responsibility with smart, targeted testing is a proven formula to prevent outbreaks -- but we cannot 'test our way' out of this pandemic," Giroir said. "Public vigilance in adhering to precautionary measures is required -- especially as we clearly see the onset of mitigation fatigue."

What happens when hospitals get overwhelmed

Some hospitals are starting to max out because of the new surge. And that's bad news for everyone -- not just those with coronavirus.

"We've seen what happened earlier in this pandemic, when hospitals become overwhelmed and patients end up not receiving care -- not only patients with coronavirus, but also patients with heart attacks and strokes and were in car accidents," emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said.

In Utah, for example, hospitals could be days away from using a patient's age, health and other factors to decide who can stay in crowded intensive care units , and who can't.

"That potentially could be occurring all over the country as our hospitals become overwhelmed," Wen said. "And unlike last time, where it was only certain parts of the country that were experiencing this, now we have virus hotspots that are occurring everywhere."

As of Monday, at least 37 states had growing numbers of new Covid-19 cases this past week compared with the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins data. Thirteen states were holding roughly steady, and no state had Covid-19 decreases of at least 10%.

More than 8.6 million people have been infected with coronavirus in the US, and more than 225,000 have died.

We have 'a narrow window of opportunity right now'

Yes, the dreaded fall surge is spreading across the country. But if we act quickly, we can prevent it from turning into a catastrophic winter surge, doctors say.

"This is not inevitable. We actually have a narrow window of opportunity right now to stop the explosive spread that is coming," Wen said Monday.

"But we have this window to take action now. That includes things like national mask mandates, that includes other targeted policies. This is not an all-or-nothing," she said.

"President Trump tends to frame this as either we shut down completely, or we literally do nothing. Actually, there's a lot that we can do that will both save lives and also keep our economy going. We should implement those policies now."

In Illinois, "there seems to be a Covid storm on the rise, and we have to get prepared," Gov. J.B. Pritzker warned Monday, announcing some restrictions starting for some regions in the state starting Wednesday.

In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little announced Monday he is moving the state back to a more restrictive phase.

And in Kentucky, a health official expressed concern about a third escalation of the virus that is starting at a higher level of infections than the first two.

"We're running a lot hotter now. It's like the popcorn is popping in the microwave at full intensity, and if we launch from here, this is where we get in trouble real fast," Dr. Steven Stack, commissioner of the Kentucky Department for Public Health, said at a news conference Monday.

A national mask mandate could help keep businesses open

A growing number of officials from across party lines are calling for a nationwide mask mandate.

Gottlieb, a former FDA head appointed by Trump, wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal titled "Winter Is Coming: Time for a Mask Mandate."

"A mandate can be expressly limited to the next two months," Gottlieb wrote, adding that it's easier to wear a mask in the winter than the summer.

"The inconvenience would allow the country to preserve health-care capacity and keep more schools and businesses open."

Andy Slavitt, former acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agreed with Gottlieb on a mask mandate.

"Scott Gottlieb was a Republican. This is not a partisan issue," said Slavitt, who served in the Obama administration.

"This is an issue for everyone's public health, and will slow down the spread of the disease."

If 95% of Americans wore masks in public, more than 100,000 lives could be saved in the United States through February, according to data released Friday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

"If people are not wearing masks, then maybe we should be mandating it," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Gottlieb wrote that mask mandates have become divisive only because of the way some politicians and political commentators have framed the issue.

"States should be able to choose how to enforce a mandate," he wrote, "but the goal should be to make masks a social and cultural norm, not a political statement."US hits highest 7-day average of coronavirus cases since the pandemic beganThe latest surge of Covid-19 infections has brought the seven-day average of new daily cases to heights not seen since the pandemic began.(CNN) The country is facing another cycle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it may be the hardest yet, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Monday.

"I think we're right now at the cusp of what's going to be exponential spread in parts of the country," Gottlieb said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

"If we took aggressive steps right now, we could potentially forestall the worst of it, but we're not going to do that," because there's a lot of fatigue and "policy resistance to taking strong action," he said.

"We really have two or three months of the acute phase of this pandemic to get through," he said. "This is going to be the hardest phase, probably."

Worst number of cases yet

That's as the country continues to report the most number of cases we've seen to date. The seven-day average of daily new cases reached an all-time high of 68,767 on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous record of 67,293 was set July 22.

"Unfortunately, I think the statement about 'new record' is going to be repeated over and over again in the days and weeks to come," said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.

"I expect that those numbers will continue to climb. Hospitalizations are going to continue to climb."

The abysmal week was marked by the two worst days of daily new cases reported since the pandemic began. More than 83,000 new cases were reported both Friday and Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins.

To be clear: This surge reflects an onslaught of new infections -- not just increased testing, contrary to what skeptics claim.

"You know why we have cases? Because we test so much," President Donald Trump claimed at a rally Saturday in North Carolina. "And in many ways, it's good. And in many ways, it's foolish."

But the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has soared 23% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins data. The seven-day average of new tests performed has risen only 2.87% over the past week, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

And we are long past the point of just urban, heavily populated areas being the only places hit hard. South Dakota's test positivity rate is 23%, the state's health department said Monday. That means of every 100 people tested, 23 have been infected. The World Health Organization in May advised governments not to reopen until test positivity rates were 5% or lower for at least 14 days.

States to receive 36.7 million rapid tests

The federal government is shipping 36.7 million rapid Covid-19 tests, and states should be receiving them by the end of the week, the US Department of Health and Human Services told CNN Monday.

The tests are intended to help states with reopening, according to an HHS news release.

"To protect seniors and to facilitate the continued re-opening of schools, businesses and the economy, the Trump Administration prioritized scaling-up our state and national point of care testing capacity," Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir, the department's assistant secretary for health, said in a news release Sunday.

President Donald Trump last month announced a plan to send 150 million BinaxNOW Covid-19 tests nationally. HHS on Monday confirmed that this week's shipments are part of that total.

"Combining personal responsibility with smart, targeted testing is a proven formula to prevent outbreaks -- but we cannot 'test our way' out of this pandemic," Giroir said. "Public vigilance in adhering to precautionary measures is required -- especially as we clearly see the onset of mitigation fatigue."

What happens when hospitals get overwhelmed

Some hospitals are starting to max out because of the new surge. And that's bad news for everyone -- not just those with coronavirus.

"We've seen what happened earlier in this pandemic, when hospitals become overwhelmed and patients end up not receiving care -- not only patients with coronavirus, but also patients with heart attacks and strokes and were in car accidents," emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said.

In Utah, for example, hospitals could be days away from using a patient's age, health and other factors to decide who can stay in crowded intensive care units , and who can't.

"That potentially could be occurring all over the country as our hospitals become overwhelmed," Wen said. "And unlike last time, where it was only certain parts of the country that were experiencing this, now we have virus hotspots that are occurring everywhere."

As of Monday, at least 37 states had growing numbers of new Covid-19 cases this past week compared with the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins data. Thirteen states were holding roughly steady, and no state had Covid-19 decreases of at least 10%.

More than 8.6 million people have been infected with coronavirus in the US, and more than 225,000 have died.

Politics, Science and the Remarkable Race for a Coronavirus VaccineThe furious race to develop a coronavirus vaccine played out against a presidential election, between a pharmaceutical giant and a biotech upstart, with the stakes as high as they could get.WASHINGTON — The call was tense, the message discouraging. Moncef Slaoui, the head of the Trump administration’s effort to quickly produce a vaccine for the coronavirus, was on the phone at 6 p.m. on Aug. 25 to tell the upstart biotech firm Moderna that it had to slow the final stage of testing its vaccine in humans.

Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, a French biochemical engineer, recognized the implication. In the race to quell the pandemic, he said, “every day mattered.” Now his company, which had yet to bring a single product to market, faced a delay of up to three weeks. Pfizer, the global pharmaceutical giant that was busy testing a similar vaccine candidate and promising initial results by October, would take the obvious lead.

“It was the hardest decision I made this year,” Mr. Bancel said.

Moderna’s problem seemed fitting for late summer 2020, when the United States was reeling from not just a pandemic but unrest over racial injustice. Dr. Slaoui informed Mr. Bancel that Moderna had not recruited enough minority candidates into its vaccine trials. If it could not prove its vaccine worked well for Black and Hispanic Americans, who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, it would not make it over the finish line.

Both companies ultimately completed the crucial stages of their human trials this month and reported spectacular initial results, vaccines that appear to be about 95 percent effective against a virus that has killed 1.3 million people, a quarter million of them in the United States.Politics, Science and the Remarkable Race for a Coronavirus VaccineThe furious race to develop a coronavirus vaccine played out against a presidential election, between a pharmaceutical giant and a biotech upstart, with the stakes as high as they could get.WASHINGTON — The call was tense, the message discouraging.

Brazil suspends Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine trial due to severe adverse event - Reuters UKBrazil's health regulator has suspended a clinical trial for China's Sinovac coronavirus vaccine citing a severe adverse event, surprising the trial organisers who countered there had been a death but it was unrelated to the vaccine.SAO PAULO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Brazil’s health regulator has suspended a clinical trial for China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine citing a severe adverse event, delighting President Jair Bolsonaro, who has criticized it for lacking credibility amid growing geopolitical tensions as the global race for a COVID-19 vaccine continues.

Brazil’s health regulator, Anvisa, said late on Monday that the event occurred on Oct. 29 but did not specify if it took place in Brazil or in another country. It also did not give an indication of how long the suspension might last.

Anvisa’s decision surprised trial organizers, who said there had been a death but it was unrelated to the vaccine.

“As there are more than 10,000 volunteers at this moment, deaths can occur ... It’s a death that has no relation with the vaccine and as such it is not the moment to interrupt the trials,” Dimas Covas, the head of Sao Paulo’s medical research institute Butantan, which is conducting the Sinovac trial, told local broadcaster TV Cultura.

Brazil’s suspension of the trial, one of Sinovac’s three large late-stage studies, and the resulting fallout underlines the increasingly fraught political atmosphere surrounding the development and distribution of potential vaccines.

The setback to Sinovac’s efforts contrasts with good news from Pfizer Inc, which said on Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who lost the U.S. election and has repeatedly blamed China for being the source of the coronavirus, has accused Pfizer of delaying its announcement until after the vote.

Bolsonaro, a longtime China skeptic and ideological ally of Trump’s, has dismissed the Sinovac vaccine as lacking in credibility. On Tuesday morning, he said on his Facebook page that the suspension was “another victory for Jair Bolsonaro.”

Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of The Global Times, published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s Communist Party, suggested on Tuesday that the proximity of the U.S. and Brazilian announcements was suspicious.

“The timing is a little strange,” he said on social media platform Weibo. “I am very worried that politics and the excessive pursuit of economic interests are deeply involved in the information release on vaccines.”

A World Health Organization spokeswoman sought to play down the politics.

“I don’t think you need to try to find reasons or explanations other than the fact that people who are looking for a vaccine ... are very cautious,” Fadela Chaib said.

TRIAL HALTED

Sinovac said in a statement on its website on Tuesday it was confident in the safety of its vaccine and will continue to communicate with Brazil on the matter. It has previously said it expects interim results of late-stage trials this year.

Butantan plans to hold a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m. local time (1400 GMT).

It is not uncommon for clinical trials to be suspended temporarily - sometimes for as short as a week - after a volunteer dies or takes ill so that trial organizers can check whether it is related to the drug being tested.

Sinovac’s vaccine is among the three experimental COVID-19 vaccines that China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use program. A Chinese health official said on Oct. 20 that serious side effects have not been observed in clinical trials.

Bolsonaro has previously said the federal government will not buy the vaccine, although he had appeared to soften his position before his celebratory social media post on Tuesday.

His stance has set a clear political battleline with the governor of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, who has said his state will both import the vaccine and produce it. Work has even begun on a plant capable of producing 100 million doses a year.

Doria, who is widely expected to challenge Bolsonaro at the next presidential election in 2022, has said a public inoculation program in Sao Paulo with the Sinovac vaccine would likely be rolled out as early as January.

Sinovac is also hoping to supply its experimental coronavirus vaccine to more South American countries by outsourcing some manufacturing procedures to Butantan.

Late stage trials are also being conducted in Indonesia and Turkey. Indonesia’s state-owned Bio Farma said on Tuesday that its Sinovac vaccine trials were “going smoothly.”

Four vaccines are being tested in Brazil seeking Anvisa approval, including those developed by Oxford University/AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical subsidiary Janssen.

Pfizer’s vaccine, developed in partnership with BioNTech SE, is undergoing late-stage tests involving 3,100 volunteers in Sao Paulo and Bahia states.

Worldwide, there are at least 10 vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization. Four of them are from China.Brazil suspends Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine trial due to severe adverse event - Reuters UKBrazil's health regulator has suspended a clinical trial for China's Sinovac coronavirus vaccine citing a severe adverse event, surprising the trial organisers who countered there had been a death but it was unrelated to the vaccine.SAO PAULO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Brazil’s health regulator has suspended a clinical trial for China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine citing a severe adverse event, delighting President Jair Bolsonaro, who has criticized it for lacking credibility amid growing geopolitical tensions as the global race for a COVID-19 vaccine continues.

Brazil’s health regulator, Anvisa, suspended the trials late on Monday saying the event occurred on Oct. 29.

The state government of Sao Paulo, where the trial is being run, said the death of a trial volunteer had been registered as a suicide and was being investigated. A police report of the incident was seen by Reuters.

The suspension further inflamed tensions between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, who has pinned his political ambitions on the Chinese vaccine which he aims to roll out in his state as early as January, with or without federal assistance.

On Tuesday, Anvisa said it would maintain the suspension and did not give any indication of how long it might last, adding it required more information on the incident. It dismissed any suggestion the move was politically motivated, saying the decision was purely technical.

The trial’s organizers criticized Anvisa’s decision, saying they had not been notified in advance and that there was no reason to stop the trial.

Although a trial volunteer had died, it had nothing to do with the vaccine, Jean Gorinchteyn, Health Secretary for the state of Sao Paulo told a news conference on Tuesday.

Dimas Covas, the head of Sao Paulo’s medical research institute Butantan, which is conducting the Sinovac trial, said the vaccine had shown no serious adverse effects. Speaking at the same news conference, he said he hoped the trial would be resumed later on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Anvisa said the initial information it received from Butantan had not specified that the death was a suicide.

Vaccine hesitancy may undermine fight against COVID-19, UK report says - ReutersAn 80% uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine may be needed to protect communities from the novel coronavirus, but volatile levels of misinformation and vaccine mistrust could undermine efforts to tackle the pandemic, British scientists said on Tuesday.FILE PHOTO: Small bottles labelled with "Vaccine" stickers stand near a medical syringe in front of displayed "Coronavirus COVID-19" words in this illustration taken April 10, 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - An 80% uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine may be needed to protect communities from the novel coronavirus, but volatile levels of misinformation and vaccine mistrust could undermine efforts to tackle the pandemic, British scientists said on Tuesday.

A report by scientific institutions the British Academy and the Royal Society found that, in part due to circulating misinformation and behavioural factors, around 36% of people in Britain say they are either uncertain or very unlikely to agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

It said an “open dialogue” is critical to building public support for COVID-19 vaccination, and called for a “frank conversation” to manage public expectations that life will not immediately get back to normal when vaccines arrive.

“Vaccines and vaccination are two very different things. To achieve the estimated 80% of uptake of a vaccine required for community protection, we need a serious, well-funded and community-based public engagement strategy,” said Melinda Mills, an Oxford University professor and expert in demographic science who led the report.

Opinion polls carried out before and during the COVID-19 pandemic across many countries show that confidence in vaccines is volatile, and that political polarization and online misinformation are likely to affect rates of uptake.

“We must learn from lessons of history and move away from the one-way provision of information and instead generate an open dialogue that addresses misinformation and does not dismiss people’s real vaccine concerns and hesitancy,” Mills said.

The report also said governments should plan now for a “phased and ethical” vaccine deployment based on transparent principles that are “sufficiently debated with the public to build understanding”.

It recommended priority groups should include health and care workers and other high-risk occupations such as teachers, bus drivers and retail workers, as well as vulnerable groups in crowded situations such as the homeless and people in prisons.Vaccine hesitancy may undermine fight against COVID-19, UK report says - ReutersAn 80% uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine may be needed to protect communities from the novel coronavirus, but volatile levels of misinformation and vaccine mistrust could undermine efforts to tackle the pandemic, British scientists said on Tuesday.FILE PHOTO: Small bottles labelled with "Vaccine" stickers stand near a medical syringe in front of displayed "Coronavirus COVID-19" words in this illustration taken April 10, 2020.

Vaccine works against mutated mink coronavirus in early animal trials: Danish scientist - Reuters IndiaA potential vaccine candidate being developed in Denmark has in early animal trials proven effective against a mutated novel coronavirus strain from mink discovered in the country, a scientist working on the vaccine said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a "Vaccine COVID-19" sticker and a medical syringe in this illustration taken April 10, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A potential vaccine candidate being developed in Denmark has in early animal trials proven effective against a mutated novel coronavirus strain from mink discovered in the country, a scientist working on the vaccine said on Thursday.

Authorities last week embarked on a plan to cull Denmark’s 17 million mink, one of the world’s largest populations, saying a recently discovered strain found in mink farms and humans could evade future COVID-19 vaccines.

Early studies of the mutated virus strain, known as Cluster 5, showed the virus to have a reduced sensitivity towards antibodies, possibly compromising the efficacy of future vaccines, authorities said last week.

But antibodies from rabbits treated with an early-stage vaccine candidate from Denmark’s State Serum Institute (SSI) successfully beat down the Cluster 5 variant, according to Anders Fomsgaard, leading scientist at SSI, which deals with infectious diseases.

“We couldn’t resist testing the rabbit antibodies we have against Cluster 5, and it works,” Fomsgaard told Danish broadcaster DR on Thursday.

The vaccine candidate, which is in early stages of development, will soon move to human trials at which it is uncertain if it will have the same effect.

“Whether this also applies to other vaccines and whether it applies to human antibodies, we do not know,” Fomsgaard said.

Reuters was unable to reach Fomsgaard for comment.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a risk assessment on Thursday there is “currently high uncertainty” about the potential threat posed by the spread of the virus into mink, its mutations, and its consequent spread back into people.Vaccine works against mutated mink coronavirus in early animal trials: Danish scientist - Reuters IndiaA potential vaccine candidate being developed in Denmark has in early animal trials proven effective against a mutated novel coronavirus strain from mink discovered in the country, a scientist working on the vaccine said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a "Vaccine COVID-19" sticker and a medical syringe in this illustration taken April 10, 2020.

Germany expects COVID-19 vaccine in first quarter 2021 at the earliest - ReutersGermany does not expect a coronavirus vaccine to be available before the first quarter of 2021, according to a copy of its national vaccine strategy seen by Reuters on Monday.BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's health minister is encouraged by a Pfizer PFE.N announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine proved effective in a late-stage trial but still does not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021, he said on Monday.

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech BNTX.O said on Monday their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study, a major victory in the fight against the pandemic.

“If this should prove true ... then it would be a good signal because it shows that this vaccine makes a difference,” Jens Spahn told a news conference, but added he was cautious on the timeline because there can always be setbacks.

To break the dynamic of the spread of the coronavirus, between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated, Spahn said. However, the first vaccines are only expected to be available in limited amounts.

Germany plans to set up centralised vaccination centres to inoculate priority groups in the first instance, which will be supported by mobile teams.

First in line for vaccines should be those who are at risk due to their age or pre-existing conditions, particularly people living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, the German research centre Leopoldina and the Ethics Council said in a position paper on priorities for vaccine delivery on Monday.

The second group should include those exposed to the virus through their jobs, such as front-line healthcare workers, who could also spread infections to vulnerable people.

For the third group, the experts proposed those who are needed to maintain public life, including health authority officials, police and security staff, firefighters and teachers.

Detailed recommendations will only be possible once late-stage data on the characteristics of vaccines is available, the experts said.

The German health ministry expects seven potential vaccines to complete testing this year or next, and is anticipating the first approvals in the first quarter of 2021, according to a copy of its national vaccine strategy paper seen by Reuters.

Vaccination will not be mandatory. The German government will pay for the vaccines, while the cost of setting up vaccination centres will be borne by the states and public and private health insurers where appropriate.

To get an overview on the effectiveness of the vaccines, Germany will collect non-personal data including information on age, sex, place of residence, vaccination date, vaccine product and vaccination dose administered, the ministry paper says.Germany expects COVID-19 vaccine in first quarter 2021 at the earliest - ReutersGermany does not expect a coronavirus vaccine to be available before the first quarter of 2021, according to a copy of its national vaccine strategy seen by Reuters on Monday.BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's health minister is encouraged by a Pfizer PFE.N announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine proved effective in a late-stage trial but still does not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021, he said on Monday.

Early Data Show Moderna's Coronavirus Vaccine Is 94/Moderna is the second company to report preliminary results from a large trial testing a vaccine. But there are still months to go before it will be widely available to the public.Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said in a statement that the results had provided “the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent Covid-19 disease, including severe disease.”

Pfizer’s chief executive, Dr. Albert Boula, tweeted congratulations to Moderna.

But the companies announced the findings in news releases, not in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and did not disclose the detailed data that would allow outside experts to evaluate their claims. Therefore, the results cannot be considered conclusive. The figures on effectiveness may change as the studies continue.

The companies’ products open the door to an entirely new way of creating vaccines — and creating them fast. Both use a synthetic version of coronavirus genetic material, called messenger RNA or mRNA, to program a person’s cells to churn out many copies of a fragment of the virus. That fragment sets off alarms in the immune system and stimulates it to attack, should the real virus try to invade. Although a number of vaccines using this technology are in development for other infections and cancers, none have yet been approved or marketed.

“The fact that two different vaccines made by two different companies with two different kinds of structures, in a new messenger RNA concept, both worked so effectively confirms the concept once and for all that this is a viable strategy not only for Covid but for future infectious disease threats,” said Dr. Barry R. Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard.

Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, said an important finding was that the vaccine appeared to prevent severe forms of the disease. Pfizer did not release information about disease severity when reporting its results.

Researchers say the positive results from Pfizer and Moderna bode well for other vaccines, because all of the candidates being tested aim at the same target — the so-called spike protein on the coronavirus that it uses to invade human cells.

Dr. Bloom said that the success of the two vaccines meant that measures of immunity used in earlier phases of the studies — participants’ antibody levels — were reliable, and that other companies could use those measures as proof of effectiveness to shorten the testing and approval process for their vaccines.Early Data Show Moderna's Coronavirus Vaccine Is 94/Moderna is the second company to report preliminary results from a large trial testing a vaccine.

Pfizer Just Filed for Emergency Approval of Its Covid-19 Vaccine.

On Friday morning, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they would be seeking an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration today for their jointly developed covid-19 vaccine. If granted, that would make this vaccine likely the first to reach the public in the U.S., followed closely by Moderna’s candidate. But what exactly happens next, and how soon can anyone expect to have access to either of these vaccines?

Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are routinely used for drugs and other treatments in times of crisis, including during this pandemic. But the situation here is largely unprecedented, since only one vaccine in the U.S. has ever gone through the EUA process before, and that was under far different circumstances. In 2005, the FDA granted the emergency use of an anthrax vaccine to U.S. soldiers who may have been at greater risk of bioterror attacks involving weaponized anthrax powder. But the vaccine had first been approved in the 1970s as protection against skin infections caused by the bacteria. Even still, the decision didn’t come without some controversy over whether the vaccine would be as effective against inhaled anthrax.

Prior to the release of Pfizer and Moderna’s preliminary results in mid-November, some experts expressed concerns about whether the FDA should even grant an EUA instead of letting the vaccines go through the standard process. One worry is that giving companies a EUA could lead them to end their ongoing clinical trials early, depriving scientists of crucial long-term data.

Earlier this week, Pfizer announced that it completed the primary goal of its trial: testing whether the first 170 participants to be diagnosed with covid-19 were more likely to have received the vaccine or a placebo. Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s results have suggested that their vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness from the coronavirus. But there are other questions, such as how long this immunity will last, that can be only answered by continuing to study people over the next two years, as originally planned.

Another concern is that people will choose not to enroll in future vaccine trials of other experimental candidates, instead opting for those already granted emergency use. Conversely, people might not want to get a vaccine that they fear was unsafely rushed out or that later turns out to have serious side effects not seen in the early data.

These potential problems will have to be weighed against the benefits of a highly effective vaccine. The country is in the middle of a raging pandemic with no clear end in sight. Though the initial supply of vaccines will be limited, this supply is likely enough to cover the millions of health care workers who will be some of the first in line to receive them.

As for what’s next, the FDA has already scheduled December 8-10 for an advisory committee of independent experts to evaluate data from any potential vaccine candidates. These committees provide recommendations on whether a treatment should win approval from the FDA, and though their advice isn’t binding, the FDA rarely disagrees with their verdict.

Potential new vaccines aren’t only evaluated by the FDA. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), run out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and similarly stocked with independent experts, also plays a part. Their recommendations guide how vaccines will be given out to the public, such as recommending that only people above a certain age should be eligible for one. Usually, their guidelines also dictate the potential out-of-pocket costs for a vaccine that could be covered by insurance, but both the outgoing Trump and incoming Biden administrations have promised that any approved covid-19 vaccines will be provided free of charge.

The ACIP is scheduled to meet on November 23, which will only be a preliminary meeting to discuss how they’ll evaluate any future covid-19 vaccines. It’s likely that the ACIP will then next convene right around the time the FDA is holding its meetings.

These meetings will probably provide the first opportunities for most outside experts to see the trial data collected so far by Pfizer and Moderna. While there had been concerns that a vaccine could have been rushed out prior to the election for political reasons, the FDA took added steps last month to ensure that any approved vaccines would have to meet strict safety standards—a move that earned plenty of scorn from Trump and other administration toadies. That should somewhat reassure anyone worried that the FDA wants to unduly rush ahead with a vaccine.

Whatever ends up happening, it’s important to remember that a vaccine for most of us is still far off. Pfizer has said that it will start mass vaccine production within hours of receiving FDA approval. But it has only pledged to produce around 25 million doses for the U.S. by the end of the year, which amounts to 12.5 million uses of the two-dose vaccine (the company has pledged another 25 million doses to other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the UK). Moderna has said it will have 20 million doses of its own two-dose vaccine by the end of 2020.

These doses would be prioritized for high-risk groups, such as health care workers and possibly the elderly. Pfizer will also still have to work out how to deploy its vaccine everywhere, since it requires extreme cold temperatures for storage; Moderna’s vaccine is said to require only standard refrigeration. For the general public, it’s almost certain that we will have to wait until late winter/early spring before any vaccines might become widely available.

So, although this is all shaping up to be good news, we’re still going to need to hunker down this winter and keep each other safe.Pfizer Just Filed for Emergency Approval of Its Covid-19 Vaccine.

Potential new vaccines aren’t only evaluated by the FDA. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), run out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and similarly stocked with independent experts, also plays a part. Their recommendations guide how vaccines will be given out to the public, such as recommending that only people above a certain age should be eligible for one. Usually, their guidelines also dictate the potential out-of-pocket costs for a vaccine that could be covered by insurance, but both the outgoing Trump and incoming Biden administrations have promised that any approved covid-19 vaccines will be provided free of charge.

The ACIP is scheduled to meet on November 23, which will only be a preliminary meeting to discuss how they’ll evaluate any future covid-19 vaccines. It’s likely that the ACIP will then next convene right around the time the FDA is holding its meetings.

These meetings will probably provide the first opportunities for most outside experts to see the trial data collected so far by Pfizer and Moderna. While there had been concerns that a vaccine could have been rushed out prior to the election for political reasons, the FDA took added steps last month to ensure that any approved vaccines would have to meet strict safety standards—a move that earned plenty of scorn from Trump and other administration toadies. That should somewhat reassure anyone worried that the FDA wants to unduly rush ahead with a vaccine.

Whatever ends up happening, it’s important to remember that a vaccine for most of us is still far off. Pfizer has said that it will start mass vaccine production within hours of receiving FDA approval. But it has only pledged to produce around 25 million doses for the U.S. by the end of the year, which amounts to 12.5 million uses of the two-dose vaccine (the company has pledged another 25 million doses to other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the UK). Moderna has said it will have 20 million doses of its own two-dose vaccine by the end of 2020.

These doses would be prioritized for high-risk groups, such as health care workers and possibly the elderly. Pfizer will also still have to work out how to deploy its vaccine everywhere, since it requires extreme cold temperatures for storage; Moderna’s vaccine is said to require only standard refrigeration. For the general public, it’s almost certain that we will have to wait until late winter/early spring before any vaccines might become widely available.

So, although this is all shaping up to be good news, we’re still going to need to hunker down this winter and keep each other safe.



Factbox: Development of AstraZeneca's potential coronavirus vaccine - ReutersAstraZeneca's experimental COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most advanced candidates in the race against the novel coronavirus.AstraZeneca's logo is reflected in a drop on a syringe needle in this illustration taken November 9, 2020.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most advanced candidates in the race to beat the coronavirus, and following Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial data in early November, eyes are now on the British company as expectations run high.

AstraZeneca confirmed in November that eagerly awaited data from late-stage clinical trials is expected by the end of this year, delaying planned deliveries of shots to the British government as a summer dip in infections pushed back test results.

Pfizer and BioNTech, meanwhile, said their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective, based on initial data. AstraZeneca called the data “incredibly promising” and said it was encouraging for other vaccine developers.

AstraZeneca has signed supply and manufacturing deals around the world for the vaccine, which data in October showed produces a immune response in both old and young adults.

Although drugmakers and researchers are also working on various treatments, vaccines are at the heart of the long-term fight to stop the virus, which has killed more than 1.2 million people, infected nearly 51 million and crippled the global economy.

Developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, the vaccine could be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate.Factbox: Development of AstraZeneca's potential coronavirus vaccine - ReutersAstraZeneca's experimental COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most advanced candidates in the race against the novel coronavirus.AstraZeneca's logo is reflected in a drop on a syringe needle in this illustration taken November 9, 2020.

Novavax's experimental coronavirus vaccine gets U.S. FDA's 'fast-track' status - Reuters UKNovavax Inc said on Monday its experimental coronavirus vaccine had gained the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "fast-track" status.FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a "Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Novavax logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020.

(Reuters) - Novavax Inc said on Monday it was on track to begin a delayed U.S.-based, late-stage study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine later this month.

The company also said the vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, had been given “fast-track” status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that it expected data from the trial could support U.S. authorization and approval.

Novavax, which is testing the vaccine in a late-stage study in the UK, last month postponed the start of its U.S. trial by roughly a month, due to delays in scaling up the manufacturing process.

A handful of companies are testing their experimental coronavirus vaccines in late-stage studies. Pfizer Inc said on Monday initial data from the pivotal trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech showed that it was more than 90% effective.

Novavax on its quarterly results conference call said Pfizer’s data was a good sign for other vaccines in development.

Fast-track status allows companies to submit sections of a marketing application on a rolling basis as soon as some data becomes available, rather than wait for all the data before seeking approval.

The company said a Phase II vaccine trial in South Africa has reached 50% of its enrollment target. It’s UK trial has enrolled 60% of its intended participants, Novavax said.Novavax's experimental coronavirus vaccine gets U.S. FDA's 'fast-track' status - Reuters UKNovavax Inc said on Monday its experimental coronavirus vaccine had gained the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "fast-track" status.FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a "Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Novavax logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020.

Some Areas of N.Y.C. Are Getting a Lot More Testing. Guess Which Ones.Coronavirus tests are free, yet data show some wealthy neighborhoods are testing at nearly four times the rate of poor neighborhoods. Why?Overwhelmingly, the wealthiest neighborhoods — in fact, most of Manhattan below 110th Street — showed the highest rates of testing, while the poorest neighborhoods, in Central Brooklyn and the South Bronx, for example, largely correlated with the lowest. In some instances, the differences between the most affluent communities and the least advantaged were four times as great.

So many months into the pandemic, these inequities might have been corrected; instead they have simply been left to persist. In September, Mr. Lieberman-Cribbin, in conjunction with fellow researchers, published a paper in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine that looked at analogous testing data for March and April and found a similar imbalance. The authors concluded that widespread testing and public-health outreach was urgently needed in the city’s most vulnerable populations.

As it happened, the tide took things in a different direction. In effect, testing among the privileged was routinized. It became a function of neurosis; of a return to office work or private school; of an iron will to avoid certain constraints and sacrifices in lifestyle. In recent years, urgent-care centers have come to fill gentrified neighborhoods, making it no harder to get a Covid test in many places than it is to pick up a box of Raisin Bran; concierge medicine, delivering quick results, has filled other parts of the void.

As Emanuela Taioli, the director of the Institute for Translational Epidemiology at Mount Sinai, pointed out, testing in Manhattan has evolved as a mechanism for screening and contact tracing, while in low-income communities, it has been deployed more narrowly as a diagnostic tool for those already experiencing symptoms or otherwise at high risk.

This is not the way to contain a virus. What concerns public-health experts is that high rates of positivity have emerged in areas with low rates of testing, which suggests that infection could be much more widespread than it appears. In the early days of the pandemic, testing was virtually impossible for all but the visibly sick. Since then, the city has created 200 testing sites, where it is free. But disseminating information about these sites — where they are, what sort of identification is needed when you get there, what risks the process might pose to immigration status and so on — has been fraught.Some Areas of N.Y.C.

On Wednesday, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced even more encouraging results from its now-completed covid-19 vaccine trial. The experimental vaccine appears to be 95% effective at preventing illness overall and seems nearly as effective in people over the age of 65, a key population . Despite the very promising findings, though, there’s still a long road ahead before most people can expect easy access to a vaccine and the pandemic reaches its end.

This vaccine is a joint collaboration between the German pharmaceutical BioNTech and Pfizer, with BioNTech largely responsible for its development in the lab, while Pfizer has bankrolled the clinical research. It’s based on a novel vaccine technology that uses messenger RNA (mRNA) to tell the body’s cells to create inert bits of spike protein from the coronavirus (the spike protein helps the virus infect cells). These bits are supposed to provoke a reaction from the immune system that trains it to recognize and defeat the real germ, should it ever come around.

Their Phase III clinical trial recruited over 40,000 volunteers and randomized them to either take two doses of the vaccine (21 days apart) or a placebo. Researchers decided prior to the study’s start that it would reach its primary endpoint once 170 people developed covid-19 across both groups. This may not sound like a lot, but it’s a number that should allow researchers to make a fair comparison between the two groups. That goal has now been met.

The results were announced by Pfizer Wednesday morning in a press release. Out of 170 people with covid-19, 162 people were in the placebo group and eight had received the vaccine, suggesting the vaccine is around 95% effective. Unlike the results presented almost two weeks ago by Pfizer—based on 94 volunteers—the company has now provided more specific patient data as well.

The rate of effectiveness was similar across gender, race and ethnicity, and age; in people over 65, the vaccine appears to be 94% effective. Of the e ight vaccinated volunteers who developed covid-19, only one developed severe illness, while nine severe cases were found in the control group. No serious safety concerns were detected among vaccine-takers , with the most common severe adverse effects limited to fatigue (reported by 3.8% of volunteers in data collected so far) and headache (2%) after the second dose.

With the primary goals of the study now met, the company plans to file for an emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration in a matter of days.

“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic. We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far and share with regulators around the world,” said Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO Pfizer, in a statement released by the company.

The results are nearly identical to those presented just this Monday by the Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical Moderna. Both vaccines rel y on mRNA , and both companies have entered into contracts with the U.S. government to mass-produce up to 100 million doses should the vaccine prove effective. Moderna has signaled that it too will file for an emergency use approval from the FDA very soon.

To be clear, the findings from both companies are as good news as one could have hoped for at this point. It wasn’t too long ago that experts would have been satisfied with a vaccine only 50% effective—that alone would have been enough to seriously turn the tide against the pandemic. This level of effectiveness, should it be genuine, would be one of the highest ever seen for a vaccine, and it bodes well for the other covid-19 vaccines in development, most of which are focusing on the same spike protein targets of the virus.

But the caveats are also important to keep in mind . Right now, all of this is based on preliminary data that hasn’t been made publicly available (the data is said to have been analyzed by a panel of independent scientists, however). Even if this is all on the level, we’re still making assumptions about how the vaccine will work in real life based on a small number of cases, which is why it’s necessary to keep an eye on the participants in these trials moving forward, as well as on people who receive the approved vaccine once it is available.

Another glaring question that can’t be answered right now is how long vaccine-provided immunity will last, as well as its potency. It’s possible, for instance, that a vaccine could prevent most people from becoming sick, but not entirely prevent their ability to transmit a silent infection to others. To understand this risk better, scientists will need information on how much virus, if any, can be found in vaccinated people recently exposed to infection—something that the clinical trial data may hopefully provide once it’s been unpacked in full. The volunteers in the Pfizer trial and others will be tracked for the next two years to test for long- term immunity and any other possible safety risks of the vaccine.

Beyond the scientific questions are the logistics. Pfizer’s vaccine requires extreme cold temperatures to be kept viable, a resource that isn’t available right now everywhere in the U.S., particularly in rural areas with few medical centers. However, Moderna’s vaccine is said to require only standard refrigeration. In either case, though, it will take time to build up the stockpiles of vaccines needed to reach everyone in the country.

It’s expected that the FDA will make a decision on whether to approve either or both vaccines for emergency use sometime in December, with doses being given out later that month or in early January. But even so, only a limited supply will be available then, and it’s likely these vaccines will be prioritized for front- line health care workers. Both the incoming Biden administration and health experts have cautioned that it may take months before the general public can have easy access to any successful vaccine. Even once available, there will still be the challenge of ensuring that people feel comfortable enough to take a vaccine—something that’s become harder in recent years .

None of this pessimism is meant to take away from the tremendous accomplishment on display here. To have created not one but two vaccines with seemingly high effectiveness in less than a year is unprecedented, and it’s a credit to the hundreds, if not thousands of scientists who have worked tirelessly during the pandemic. And there are still more vaccines now racing to the finish line, which could fill other unmet needs, such as being inexpensive enough to mass produce for lower-income countries.

Personally, I’m cautiously optimistic about the course of the pandemic in the medium- to long-term, given these vaccine results. However, I’m deeply concerned about the short term. The pandemic has reached a terrifying new peak, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Last week, according to data collected from the World Health Organization, was the deadliest recorded so far, with almost 60,000 deaths worldwide. This week doesn’t seem to be shaping much better. It’s likely that deaths in the U.S. will surpass over 2,000 a day by Christmas , and there’s no sign of the pandemic abating anytime soon, nor of the federal government doing much of anything about it.

Hope is absolutely on the horizon, but it’s going to be a very rocky last mile getting there.

‘It’s Traumatizing’: Coronavirus Deaths Are Climbing Once AgainDeaths are far below the rate of the spring, when as many as 2,200 people were dying every day, but experts warn they are rising fast.Things seemed to be improving, but Mr. Sierra Macias took a turn for the worse. He was 49.

Mr. Alvarado said it was difficult to contend with such loss even as people around him seemed not to be taking the virus seriously, believing it was being overhyped or thinking, somehow, that it was not dangerous.

“It seems like people think the news are overthinking, overtalking,” said Mr. Alvarado, who said he was waiting for paperwork to send his father-in-law’s body for burial in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, where cemeteries are running out of room. “You don’t realize the situation until you live through it.”

Improved medical treatments for the virus have emerged in the months since it first arrived in the United States, offering hope that even if cases soared before a vaccine was available, deaths might be held off.

A steroid, dexamethasone, has been shown to help the seriously ill; a new antibody treatment, similar to a therapy given to President Trump shortly after he contracted the coronavirus, just won emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration; and doctors now know to turn patients on their stomachs to improve oxygen flow, one of the many best practices that have emerged over months of contending with Covid-19. The case fatality rate — a crude measure that looks at the share of people who die out of those who are known to have tested positive — has fallen throughout the pandemic, according to public health experts. That is in part because the country is conducting far more tests, and also because the age demographics have changed, with more cases among young people, who are less likely to get seriously ill.

Still, hospitals are now filling with patients, threatening the limits of medical systems in some regions. More than 68,000 people are in the hospital with the virus, greater than two earlier peaks in the spring and summer. Even the best medicines and techniques lose their usefulness if too many people get sick at the same time, taxing staffing and supplies.

“When you’ve overwhelmed the health care system, nobody is going to get optimal care,” said Dr. Jessica Justman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.‘It’s Traumatizing’: Coronavirus Deaths Are Climbing Once AgainDeaths are far below the rate of the spring, when as many as 2,200 people were dying every day, but experts warn they are rising fast.Things seemed to be improving, but Mr. Sierra Macias took a turn for the worse. He was 49.

Mr. Alvarado said it was difficult to contend with such loss even as people around him seemed not to be taking the virus seriously, believing it was being overhyped or thinking, somehow, that it was not dangerous.

“It seems like people think the news are overthinking, overtalking,” said Mr. Alvarado, who said he was waiting for paperwork to send his father-in-law’s body for burial in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, where cemeteries are running out of room. “You don’t realize the situation until you live through it.”

Improved medical treatments for the virus have emerged in the months since it first arrived in the United States, offering hope that even if cases soared before a vaccine was available, deaths might be held off.

A steroid, dexamethasone, has been shown to help the seriously ill; a new antibody treatment, similar to a therapy given to President Trump shortly after he contracted the coronavirus, just won emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration; and doctors now know to turn patients on their stomachs to improve oxygen flow, one of the many best practices that have emerged over months of contending with Covid-19. The case fatality rate — a crude measure that looks at the share of people who die out of those who are known to have tested positive — has fallen throughout the pandemic, according to public health experts. That is in part because the country is conducting far more tests, and also because the age demographics have changed, with more cases among young people, who are less likely to get seriously ill.

Still, hospitals are now filling with patients, threatening the limits of medical systems in some regions. More than 68,000 people are in the hospital with the virus, greater than two earlier peaks in the spring and summer. Even the best medicines and techniques lose their usefulness if too many people get sick at the same time, taxing staffing and supplies.

“When you’ve overwhelmed the health care system, nobody is going to get optimal care,” said Dr. Jessica Justman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.

A Scottish mother with cancer will be allowed to go on a "final holiday" with her children despite Scotland's travel ban, Nicola Sturgeon has said.

Linzi Page, 38, who has stage-four cancer, will be exempt from rules preventing people traveling between Level 3 and Level 4 regions.

At First Minister's Questions Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked about Ms Page's plan to fly to Tenerife from Edinburgh.

Ms Sturgeon said she had spoken to Ms Page on Thursday morning.

"She told me that the family have had a tough year and that this holiday would be 'a nice memory for us'," the first minister said. "She said it is a precious time with the family which we will never get back."

Ms Sturgeon said she had told Ms Page travel for "compassionate reasons which relate to the end of a person's life" is exempt and the family is allowed to go on holiday.

"Under the regulations, anyone in a situation like hers can go on a final holiday," she said, adding: "Linzi's situation is tragic but on both compassionate and indeed on legal grounds, she can go on her holiday and I wish her and her family well."Coronavirus updates: Latest vaccine trials show promising results - BBC News<ol><li>Coronavirus updates: Latest vaccine trials show promising results  BBC News

Biden Implores Trump to Confront Surging Coronavirus PandemicPresident Trump broke his near-total silence on the coronavirus on Friday with an appearance in the Rose Garden in which he threatened to deny New York access to a vaccine.But by the time broader distribution of a vaccine is underway next spring, Mr. Trump’s presidency will have long ended.

A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, responded on Twitter, saying that Mr. Trump “has failed with his pandemic response, lied to Americans about how bad it was when he knew otherwise & was fired by voters for his incompetence. @NYGovCuomo is fighting to ensure the communities hit hardest by Covid get the vaccine. Feds providing 0 resources.”

Federal resources were very much on the minds of state officials as they grappled with infection numbers shooting skyward and hospitals on the verge of being overrun.

Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, where the number of new cases reached a daily record 8,256 on Thursday, said whatever Mr. Trump said now could not make up for his refusals to wear a mask and his embrace of large public gatherings, at campaign rallies and at the White House.

While the outgoing administration could still help, Gov. Evers said, “they also report to a president who, frankly, isn’t the most consistent one as it relates to the things that count: masks, and making sure you’re not in public gatherings with a whole bunch of people to spread the disease.”

“They’re not going to play a huge political role here,” he added.

Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said much of the department’s response had been paid for by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, which is set to expire Dec. 31, thanks in part to Mr. Trump’s failure to negotiate new relief despite months of wrangling with Congress.

Kim Deti, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming Department of Health, said health officials there were also concerned about having enough money to continue contact tracing and other operations that they believed had kept the state’s virus cases low for much of the year.Biden Implores Trump to Confront Surging Coronavirus PandemicPresident Trump broke his near-total silence on the coronavirus on Friday with an appearance in the Rose Garden in which he threatened to deny New York access to a vaccine.But by the time broader distribution of a vaccine is underway next spring, Mr. Trump’s presidency will have long ended.

Factbox: Development of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - ReutersU.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech on Monday became the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech on Monday became the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.

FILE PHOTO: The new logo of German biotech firm BioNTech is seen outside the company's headquarters in Mainz, Germany, September 17, 2020. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo

The companies said the vaccine was more than 90% effective and they have so far found no serious safety concerns, priming it for possible speedy regulatory approvals.

Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. emergency use authorisation in the U.S. of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85 in coming weeks.

To do so, it will need to have collected two months of safety follow-up data on around half of the study’s roughly 44,000 participants, expected in late November.

Pfizer and BioNTech, which already collaborate to develop mRNA-based vaccines for influenza, currently expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine in 2020 - enough to protect 25 million people - and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

Below are the main details of the vaccine and Pfizer’s progress on supply deals and potential approvals:

TYPE

- The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines

DOSAGE AND EXPECTED COST

- Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment.

- Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay.

- BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunisation effect of the vaccine would last for a year although that was not certain yet.

DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE

- U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July and the vaccine showed promise in second early trial.

- The company has said it could file for emergency approval in the United States in November.

- Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and target clinical trials in April.

- Testing of vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month.Factbox: Development of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - ReutersU.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech on Monday became the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech on Monday became the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.

JGBs little changed as domestic coronavirus cases rise - ReutersYields on Japanese government bonds were little changed on Thursday as concerns about rising domestic coronavirus cases offset optimism about a vaccine.TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Yields on Japanese government bonds were little changed on Thursday as concerns about rising domestic coronavirus cases offset optimism about a vaccine.

Earlier on Thursday, Tokyo raised its alert level to the highest of four stages after daily coronavirus cases rose to new record highs in the Japanese capital.

New infections are rising in other parts of Japan, raising concerns that authorities will place new restrictions on economic activity.

Prices for government bonds were also supported after an auction of one-year bills on Thursday was met with healthy demand.

Benchmark 10-year JGB futures barely moved at 152.17, with a trading volume of 8,239 lots.

The 10-year JGB yield was flat at 0.015%. The 20-year JGB yield was flat at 0.385%.

The 30-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.630%, while the 40-year JGB yield was flat at 0.665%.

The five-year yield was flat at minus 0.120%.

[Follow our live Covid-19 updates around the world.]

N.Y. will limit private gatherings and require bars and restaurants to close daily at 10 p.m. Union Square in Manhattan on Monday. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times With coronavirus cases surging in New York and across the country, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that private indoor and outdoor gatherings statewide would be limited to 10 people and that gyms, bars and restaurants must close daily at 10 p.m. The restrictions will take effect Friday, and Mr. Cuomo said that local governments will be responsible for enforcing them. The limit on gatherings will apply to private homes. The curfew will apply only to bars and restaurants licensed by the state liquor authority, and restaurants can continue to provide takeout and delivery after 10 p.m., but only for food. Mr. Cuomo said that officials were moved to announce the new restrictions as they confronted an increase in cases. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties,” Mr. Cuomo said on a conference call with reporters. “That’s where it’s coming from, primarily.” After months when the New York City area had seemed to keep the pandemic relatively contained, the virus has again increased sharply in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the region that was once at the center of the U.S. outbreak. Though cases and hospitalizations are significantly lower than they were at the spring peak, officials in all three states have acknowledged that they are considering additional restrictions that would roll back the slow, cautious reopening process — particularly as cooling weather drives people indoors, where the virus more easily spreads. In a marked difference from the spring, the wave in the metropolitan area coincides with a surge nationwide. The United States has been shattering daily records for new cases, pushing the seven-day average to more than 123,000 per day, as of Tuesday, according to a New York Times database. For the first time, new cases surpassed 140,000 on Wednesday. And 65,368 people were hospitalized across the country with Covid-19 on Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, the largest number at any point during the pandemic. “And New York is a ship on the Covid tide,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that the citywide seven-day average rate of positive test results was at 2.52 percent — a rate last seen in early June, when the city had only just begun reopening nonessential business after a devastating spring that saw thousands die. “This is our LAST chance to stop a second wave,” Mr. de Blasio wrote on Twitter. “We can do it, but we have to act NOW.” Cases have since been rising across all five boroughs, including Staten Island, which has long bristled at virus-related limits. Over the past week, New York City has seen an average of 1,142 cases a day, a jump of 77 percent from just two weeks earlier. Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that parts of Staten Island would be designated a “yellow zone” in his color-coded tier system of restrictions, which requires more testing in schools. The state has also designated parts of Port Chester, a suburban community of about 29,000 in Westchester County on the border with Connecticut, as an “orange zone,” which closes schools for at least four days, limits capacity at religious institutions, bans indoor dining and closes high-risk businesses like gyms and hair salons. In New York State, the seven-day average rate of positive test results was 2.43 percent on Wednesday, the highest the figure has been since late May when the state was doing less testing than it is now. The state also reported 1,628 hospitalizations, its highest total since mid-June, though far short of the peak in April of more than 18,000. In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy has put new limits on indoor dining that begin Thursday night, in what he said was a bid to avoid the sweeping shutdowns that brought the region’s economy to a standstill in March. New Jersey’s coronavirus hospitalizations have more than doubled in the last month, from 653 to 1,801. The number of people hospitalized has also surged in Connecticut, to 548, the highest total since May 29, according to state data. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut has also limited all private gatherings in the state to 10 people, lowered capacity limits on restaurants and allowed the hardest-hit municipalities to reimpose limits on other businesses. —

The Ohio governor issues a mask mandate, joining other states that are implementing new restrictions. Wearing masks are now required at businesses in Ohio as new restrictions to prevent coronavirus infections go into effect. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Some have pleaded. Some cajoled. Some scolded. Some invoked the past, some the future. Since Election Day, more than one-third of the governors across the United States have issued public appeals for people to take coronavirus prevention measures seriously, as the number of cases and hospitalizations spike in most of the country. In a televised address, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio invoked the Veterans Day holiday on Wednesday, noting that previous generations had laid down their lives to protect the country. “Today we all must do something far less dramatic, but very important,” he said. “Wear a mask, so that your friends, neighbors and family members might live.” To put teeth into that admonition, the governor announced that stores would be closed for 24 hours if a team of inspectors found that workers or customers at any retailer ignored the mask rule two times. In other measures, he banned dancing and games at social gatherings, and said participants in banquets, weddings and funeral receptions could no longer congregate. If the numbers continued to mount, Gov. DeWine said, there would be new restrictions on bars, restaurants and gyms within a week, and universities would be asked to stick to remote learning in January. In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers made a similar prime-time speech on Tuesday night, advising residents to change their lives to help contain the virus. “It’s not safe to have others over — it’s just not safe,” Mr. Evers said, adding that virtual hangouts were better for the foreseeable future. “So please, cancel the happy hours, dinner parties, sleepovers and play dates at your home. ” Numerous governors warned that new mandatory measures, which many have avoided, might be coming if mounting case counts put severe pressure on medical facilities. In Nevada, Gov. Steve Sisolak cautioned residents that they had roughly 14 days to get in line. “Nevadans need to accept and understand this reality now, and change behaviors immediately,” he said at a news conference Tuesday. “In the next two weeks, we must see a significant reversal of the current trends, which are deeply concerning now.” Many governors have pleaded for patience, recognizing that combating Covid-19 has been a difficult slog. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, stressing the positive preliminary results that Pfizer announced on Monday for its experimental vaccine, said, “I hope the good news about a vaccine inspires us to double down on social distancing in Colorado.” Some governors appealed to patriotism, or unity, or protecting the family. In Idaho, where virus prevention measures have drawn protests about tyranny, Gov. Brad Little cited Veterans Day too. “Our veterans bravely encountered bullets and bombs so that you can have the freedom to control your own actions,” the governor wrote in an opinion piece. “And your personal actions are the one and only thing that will defend our veterans from succumbing to the enemy virus.” Inevitably some, including the governors of North Carolina, Iowa and Indiana, have imposed new measures in all or part of their states, often focused on indoor gatherings. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that private indoor and outdoor gatherings statewide would be limited to 10 people and that gyms, bars and restaurants must close nightly at 10 p.m. starting Friday. The Federal government got in the act too, with the National Park Service announcing this week that the 98th National Tree Lighting Ceremony would not include a live audience. The ceremony will be streamed at thenationaltree.org on Thursday, Dec. 3, and the tree on display there throughout the season. California is about to broach the one million case mark, a threshold reached only by Texas so far, with more than 996,000 cases as of Wednesday and a recent average of more than 6,400 cases a day. San Francisco has banned indoor dining again starting next Sunday, paused high school reopenings and limited gyms and movie theaters to 25 percent of capacity. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the state’s numbers “sobering” and predicted that they would probably climb with the onset of winter, in a “twindemic” of Covid-19 and flu. Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah took some of the most drastic recent measures, declaring a new state of emergency on Sunday and instituting a statewide mask mandate. One of the bluntest entreaties came in Maryland, which lowered the ceiling on indoor dining capacity to 50 percent of capacity Wednesday and capped indoor gatherings at 25 people. In a news conference last week, Gov. Larry Hogan warned against complacency. “I mean, it’s simple, it’s not that hard,” he said. “Just wear the damn masks.” —

Several hundred people gathered at the event in the East Room for several hours, many of them not wearing masks as they mingled and watched election returns. After another event at the White House — a celebration of Mr. Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Sept. 26 — more than a dozen aides, reporters and guests who were in attendance or came into contact with people who were there tested positive for the virus. —

Newark’s mayor imposes new restrictions as the city reaches a positivity rate of 19%. A line of customers order at Calandra’s Bakery in Newark on Wednesday, as the city operates under new restrictions because of a sharp increase of coronavirus cases. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Two weeks ago, as the coronavirus began to spread widely again in Newark, officials imposed New Jersey’s toughest new restrictions since the spring lockdown, mandating an 8 p.m. indoor closing time for all restaurants, bars and nonessential businesses citywide. But the number of new cases in Newark, the state’s largest city, kept climbing, with 842 new reported infections over the last four days. Of those people tested in Newark over three days last week, 19 percent were found to have the virus, city and county officials said — more than double the statewide rate, and almost eight times the rate in New York State. The uptick mirrors a spike in Covid-19 hospitalizations across New Jersey to levels not seen since June. On Tuesday, New Jersey recorded 3,777 new infections, the most since April — a figure the governor called “devastating.” Hospitals also reported 15 coronavirus deaths, adding to the state’s pandemic death toll of more than 16,400. Newark sits just a few miles west of New York City, where officials are struggling to contain a spike on Staten Island and bracing for a second wave of cases. Alarmed by the new data, Newark’s mayor, Ras J. Baraka, implemented a sweeping set of rules on Tuesday designed to avoid a repeat of the springtime outbreak. Mr. Baraka ordered a 9 p.m. weekday curfew for residents of three ZIP codes, and canceled all team sports activities citywide, effective immediately. He barred Newark’s nursing homes from accepting visitors for two weeks, and capped gatherings — indoors and outdoors — at 10 people until at least Dec. 1. Aides said Mr. Baraka would not hesitate to shut down businesses, issue fines and suspend liquor licenses if needed. The tough talk created tension between Gov. Philip D. Murphy and Mr. Baraka, allies and fellow Democrats. Mr. Murphy this week imposed a 10 p.m. closing time on restaurants and bars, among other restrictions, but he has resisted ordering a statewide lockdown.When asked about Newark’s rules, Mr. Murphy’s top lawyer, Parimal Garg, said that state law superseded municipal actions. Perry N. Halkitis, a dean of biostatistics and urban-global public health at the School of Public Health at Rutgers University,said that an emphasis on quelling indoor drinking during late-night hours, when inhibitions drop, was appropriate. He also said he was equally concerned about private indoor gatherings that are harder to monitor. “You really love your family?” said Dr. Halkitis. “For Thanksgiving, you should not be with them.” — Kevin Armstrong and

Wincing at high community case rates, major districts put off reopening schools. Princess Bryant, a Boston public school teacher, holds her kindergarten class via video-conference from her apartment. Credit... Brian Snyder/Reuters School officials in Philadelphia, San Diego, Minneapolis and several other large cities hit pause on their reopening plans this week, joining a number of districts across the United States that have delayed bringing students back to classrooms because of surging coronavirus cases. Washington and Boston have also reversed course on reopenings recently, and Chicago has not yet set a return date. Any school district that has not already reopened its classrooms is now facing significant headwinds to do so in 2020. Although research indicates that children are less likely than adults to spread the virus, many health experts say that schools cannot safely reopen while community transmission is rampant — even though remote schooling can carry a heavy social and economic cost. “Most of the country — when you look at the map, a lot of them have case rates that I would say are too high to open schools,” said Benjamin Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University. “It’s a crisis for public education.” There are many parts of the United States — including Florida, Texas and New York City — where schools are fully or partially open. Baltimore still plans to bring some students back to classrooms next week, though it has slashed the number of schools that will reopen. With the country posting record numbers of cases and hospitalizations, the window for reopening is closing rapidly. Much will depend on the course the pandemic takes over the next few months, as colder weather drives people to spend more time indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. Gatherings for Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holidays are also likely to sow new outbreaks. “If we put a plan in place and really try to control the epidemic, I think it’s possible that schools could stay open or reopen in January or February,” Dr. Linas said. “But that is going to require a national Covid strategy.” — Amelia Nierenberg and

These researchers tested positive for the coronavirus, but not because they were infected. Dr. Timothy Wannier, a researcher at Harvard University, came into contact with the coronavirus’s genetic material, which caused him to test positive for the disease without being infected. Credit... Adam Glanzman for The New York Times Scientists in at least half a dozen universities and research centers in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus — not because they were infected, but because they were studying the virus’s genetic material and that contaminated their tests. In recent months, labs around the country have begun research projects that involve the coronavirus’s genes, harmless hunks of molecules that pose no infectious threat. But those genes also happen to be the targets of several widely used coronavirus tests. Researchers who inadvertently inhale or touch the genetic material may be contaminating the swabs used to sample their airways, tricking tests into labeling them as infected, even when they are actually virus-free. Contaminated positives such as these are extremely rare, health experts said. People outside the research community should not worry about their own test results. Blame also should not be pinned on the test, which did its intended job of rooting out the virus’s genetic material. “This isn’t the fault of any test,” said Dr. Rosemary She, a pathologist and diagnostics expert at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the contamination events. “This is human error.” But in a nation with a patchwork approach to testing, and where a great many researchers have rapidly pivoted to studying the coronavirus, contaminations are occurring with unexpected frequency. These issues have struck labs at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown University, Roger Williams University, Cornell University and elsewhere, delivering puzzling results to anxious scientists, prompting building closures and fueling frustration with tests — which could cause people to avoid taking them altogether, damaging efforts to keep the virus in check. “We’ve never had a situation where so many labs work on a pathogen” amid a pandemic and had so much asymptomatic testing, said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of California who was not involved in the contamination events. As a result, there are few contingency plans in place to deal with such unusual testing errors. Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against retesting people within 90 days of a positive result. There are no explicit exceptions for potential contamination. Many individuals whose tests were likely contaminated, across several institutions, stopped getting tested for weeks or months because their positive results had been treated as legitimate, despite the possibility they were still vulnerable to the virus. Without more flexibility in their policies to account for these unusual testing errors, Dr. Butler-Wu said, states and universities could soon “have an outbreak on their hands.” —

Two new studies by the U.S. Navy confirm the need for strict coronavirus testing protocols. Marine recruits training on an obstacle course at Parris Island Recruit Depot, S.,C., in May. Credit... Lolita Baldor/Associated Press Young, healthy people who contract the coronavirus are often asymptomatic, very rarely need hospital care and can transmit the virus to a roommate unwittingly even when following strict quarantine orders, according to two new studies from the U.S. Navy. The findings support the need for strong measures, like daily testing, that go beyond the temperature checks and symptom reporting now commonly deployed to prevent transmission in offices, dormitories and other group settings, the authors said. “These findings all point to the need for ongoing testing strategies,” said Dr. Andrew G. Letizia, a commander and infectious disease specialist at the Naval Medical Research Center, in Silver Spring, Md., and lead author of one of the studies. “We need to augment public health measures and reinforce them with regular testing” in such settings. The new reports, both posted Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine, clarify much of what is known or suspected about the coronavirus’s effect on young adults, while also exposing the limits of quarantine measures. One study, led by Dr. Letizia, detailed the rate of new infections detected among nearly 2,000 recruits under quarantine near Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot, in South Carolina, over the summer. It was conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The other report described an outbreak on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier on which nearly a quarter of the crew — more than 1,200 seamen and women — tested positive last spring. “The approaches learned from the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt and Parris Island can be applied, with varying degrees of relevance, to land-based shared living situations,” wrote Dr. Nelson L. Michael, of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, in an accompanying editorial, “such as college dormitories, prisons, and residential care facilities, as well as sports training environments, meat-processing facilities, and isolated energy plants.” —

Disease experts see Covid-19 trends worsening in the U.S. Tents for patients who tested positive for Covid-19 outside of a hospital in El Paso on Tuesday. Credit... Joel Angel Juarez for The New York Times Infectious disease experts warned on Wednesday that the surge in coronavirus cases in many parts of the United States is likely to get much worse over the next few weeks. And despite the recent promising news about a vaccine by the drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech, wide distribution of a vaccine will take time. “It’s helpful to know there is an end in sight, but that end is not going to appear magically in January, February or March,” said Dr. Andrew Pavia, an infectious disease specialist at University of Utah School of Medicine, at a news conference by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on Wednesday about the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas. “That end is next summer or fall,” Dr. Pavia said. “That’s a hard message to give, but it’s critical.” On Monday, Pfizer said an early analysis of its vaccine trial found the vaccine to be more than 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19. But that initial finding could change as the trial goes on. Dr. Pavia noted that in his region, the Mountain West, the health care system was already strained as the holiday season loomed. “The situation in the hospitals is going to be quite a bit worse in the next two to three weeks than it is today,” he said. “If Thanksgiving does the same thing to us that Memorial Day did and Labor Day did, and people gather, as we all want to do, without taking precautions, we could see another acceleration going into Christmas.” He noted that even if a vaccine is approved soon, people must continue to rely on masks and social distancing for months to come, because initial vaccine supplies will be limited and will be reserved for health care workers and other front line workers. Dr. Pavia and Dr. Daniel McQuillen, who is the president-elect of the association, called for an end to the politicization of the pandemic, and for leaders to send a clear, consistent message backed by scientific data to promote health precautions that can be taken by individuals. Dr. McQuillen said public health agencies and political leaders, including President Trump, “need to tell the truth, and tell people what the reality is and how we’re going to get out of it, without any sugarcoating.” Dr. Pavia added: “We have to take politics out of this. Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, you’re susceptible to the virus, and masks work just as well.” —

Maryland football halts all activities and cancels game against Ohio State after players test positive. Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa during a game against Minnesota on Oct. 30. Credit... Julio Cortez/Associated Press The University of Maryland halted its football-related activities on Wednesday and canceled its game this weekend against Ohio State after eight players tested positive for the virus within the past seven days. “We realize that this news is disappointing to all of the Maryland fans out there who were looking forward to the Terps taking on an outstanding Ohio State team, but the responsible thing for us to do is pause football activities,” said Damon Evans, Maryland’s athletic director, in the announcement. Michael Locksley, the team’s coach, said it would continue to meet virtually while in-person activities were on pause. The cancellation means three out of the top five teams in The Associated Press Top 25 poll will be sidelined this weekend because of the virus. The University of Alabama, ranked No. 1, was scheduled to play Louisiana State University before positive test results among L.S.U. players prompted the Southeastern Conference to postpone the game. Texas A&M, ranked No. 5, was supposed to play at the University of Tennessee but had to stop practicing after several members of their organization tested positive for the virus on Monday. In total, four SEC games set for this weekend were delayed because of positive tests across programs. “Numbers around contact tracing have emerged as one of our biggest challenges to playing,” said SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey in a call with reporters Wednesday. “Adjustments have to continually be made.” The Big Ten, unlike the SEC and some other conferences, planned to not reschedule games this season that cannot be played because of the pandemic. —

South Africa will lift restrictions on all international travel. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript South Africa Will Lift International Travel Restrictions President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa announced Wednesday that the country will open its borders to all international travelers despite an increasing number of coronavirus cases in some parts of the country. The Covid-19 U.I.F. scheme has already paid out nearly 53 billion to over 4.7 million workers. These relief measures were necessary to protect those who are most vulnerable in a time of great distress. But they will have to come to an end as we do not, as a government, have sufficient resources to continue. As we transition to a new phase in our response, the only way forward is a rapid and sustained economic recovery. We are, therefore, working to enable all parts of our economy to return to full operation as quickly and as safely as possible. We are amending the Alert Level 1 regulations to restore normal trading hours, for instance, for the sale of alcohol at retail outlets. We are also opening up international travel to all countries subject to the necessary health protocols and the presentation of a negative Covid-19 certificate. Now by utilizing rapid tests and strict monitoring, we intend to limit the spread of the infection through importation by those who will be traveling to our country. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa announced Wednesday that the country will open its borders to all international travelers despite an increasing number of coronavirus cases in some parts of the country. Credit Credit... Nic Bothma/EPA, via Shutterstock South Africa will open its borders to all international travelers, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Wednesday, even as the number of new coronavirus cases rises in some parts of the country, leaving some officials concerned that a rollback on travel restrictions could invite a second wave. “We are also opening up international travel to all countries subject to the necessary health protocols and the presentation of a negative Covid-19 certificate,” said Mr. Ramaphosa during an address to the country. He did not say when the new rules would replace a current, lengthy no-fly list that bans tourists from dozens of European countries and the United States. The announcement came ahead of what would normally be the beginning of peak tourist season, when colder weather in the northern hemisphere starts luring up to 10 million foreigners to the country’s pristine beaches and game safaris. South Africa has recorded more than 740,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 20,000 deaths since the spring, according to a New York Times database. Cases have dropped from a high of 12,000 new daily infections in July to fewer than 2,000 a day for the past three months. Still, localized spikes in cases have worried officials for several weeks, including in the Eastern Cape province and in Cape Town, a major tourist destination. The government also declared five days of mourning for victims of the pandemic and for women and children who are victims of violence. South Africa has one of the world’s highest rates of violence against women, which Mr. Ramaphosa called a “second pandemic.” He said the national flag would fly at half-mast, and urged all citizens to wear black armbands on Nov. 25. —

GLOBAL ROUNDUP Lebanon will lock down again, and other news from around the world. A virus testing site in Haret Hreik, south of Beirut, in October. Credit... Xinhua News Agency Lebanon is imposing a new lockdown that will shut many businesses and limit road traffic as the small Mediterranean country tries to limit a spike in coronavirus cases that has stretched hospital resources. The new lockdown, which the government announced on Tuesday, will begin Saturday and last until Nov. 30. Many businesses and government offices will close, cars will be allowed on the road on alternate days based on the last number of their license plates and a nighttime curfew will be enforced, although its hours have yet to be decided. While the measures have been billed as a “total lockdown,” the country’s sea, air and land borders will remain open, as will establishments deemed “essential,” such as pharmacies, bakeries, banks and electricity and communications facilities. Lebanon, a small, beleaguered country of 5.4 million bordered by Syria and Israel, reported surprisingly low infection numbers early in the pandemic, mostly because of a strict early lockdown that included an airport closure. But cases have risen steadily in recent months, as have virus-related deaths, a rise that medical workers have blamed on spotty mask-wearing and lax observance of social distancing guidelines. The new lockdown comes amid an economic crisis that has seen unemployment spike and the currency lose about 80 percent of its value against the United States dollar since last year. A huge explosion in the Beirut port in August killed nearly 200 people and caused billions of dollars in damages. Since February, 96,907 people have contracted the virus and 749 people have died in connection to the virus, according to a Times database. In other developments around the world: Spain’s government announced Wednesday that it would require travelers arriving in Spain from high-risk countries to prove they tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours before landing. The order, which goes into effect Nov. 23, has long been demanded by some regional politicians, particularly in Madrid, whose regional leader, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has blamed untested travelers arriving at Madrid’s airport for helping to spread the virus in the capital region.

Singapore and Hong Kong said that a travel bubble between the two Asian financial centers will begin this month, allowing travelers to bypass quarantine. The arrangement, set to begin on Nov. 22, would allow one designated “bubble” flight into each city every day, each carrying a maximum of 200 passengers. Travelers must test negative for the virus and fly only on the designated flights.

The European Union’s executive arm proposed a “European Health Union” in a bid to coordinate a patchwork of Covid-19 measures across the bloc and centralize responses to the pandemic. The proposal by the European Commission, which would need to be approved by the European Parliament and member countries, would create an E.U.-wide plan to prepare for future health crises, as well as coordinate Covid-19 testing across the bloc. — Ben Hubbard, Raphael Minder, Tiffany May and

The risk of dying from Covid-19 is higher for people with intellectual disabilities. A testing site in Milwaukee last week. People with intellectual disabilities are vulnerable to the virus for several reason Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times People with intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders are three times as likely to die from Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, compared with other people who contract the disease, according to a large analysis of insurance claims data. The finding raises complex questions about how new vaccines should be allocated when they become available in limited supplies. So far, the guidelines for distributing vaccines in the U.S. have recommended giving first priority to workers in emergency services, health care and other essential roles, as well as people who are at heightened risk for severe disease if they become infected, including some older adults and those with certain chronic illnesses. The guidelines, which are still evolving, have not specifically emphasized vaccinating children and adults with intellectual disabilities like Down syndrome and developmental disorders. The new analysis was performed by FAIR Health, a nonprofit group that claims to host the nation’s largest private health insurance claims database, in collaboration with Dr. Marty Makary, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the West Health Institute, a group of nonprofit organizations focused on aging and on lowering health care costs for older people. The analysis was evaluated only by an academic reviewer, and it has not been published in a scientific journal. “There has always been some hesitancy to treat people with intellectual disabilities and people who are institutionalized as equal, in terms of consideration for scarce medical resources — and that also includes prisoners, by the way,” said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “There will be some balking and battling, on grounds that I would consider discriminatory.” People with intellectual disabilities are vulnerable to the virus for several reasons. Many live in group homes or receive care from aides, therapists or teachers who must be in close physical proximity in order to assist them. And many are medically frail to begin with, with high rates of other underlying health conditions, particularly respiratory problems. “Historically, it’s been a challenge for this population to receive good medical care,” said Scott Landes, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University. “If you’ve got someone whose cognitive ability is severely reduced, just understanding what’s going on and why they have to wear a mask would be very confusing.” —

Russia’s vaccine proves effective in early trial data, company says. A nurse giving a volunteer a coronavirus vaccine in Moscow in September. Credit... Natalia Kolesnikova/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Russia’s coronavirus vaccine has shown strong effectiveness in early data from a clinical trial, according to a statement on Wednesday from the Russian financial company promoting the shot. The Russian Direct Investment Fund said that the vaccine, called Sputnik V, demonstrated 92 percent efficacy, based on results from 20 people in the trial who developed Covid-19 after getting either the experimental vaccine or a placebo shot. Because few scientific details were given, independent vaccine experts could not fully assess its veracity. “It’s very hard to say much with 20 cases and no other details,” said Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University. The scientists behind the Russian vaccine have not released the trial blueprints, known as protocols, which are needed for a thorough review of the data. The Russian developer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, plans to publish details of the interim results in a peer-reviewed article, the Russian Direct Investment Fund said in its statement. The results are not implausible, especially considering the news from earlier in the week that Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was “more than 90 percent effective” in preventing the illness. Like all vaccines now in clinical trials, the Pfizer and Sputnik V vaccines present a coronavirus protein called “spike” to the immune system. Because Pfizer’s data was so strong, “it boosts my confidence in other vaccines as well,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida who specializes in infectious disease outbreaks. There are now 11 vaccines in late-stage clinical trials worldwide, including three in Russia. Since August, Russia has sought to get ahead in the global race to market vaccines by announcing its product was effective before clinical trials showed that to be the case, and by approving it for emergency use at home. China has also approved a vaccine for emergency use before its trials are completed. The World Health Organization rebuked Russia for skipping steps in the approval process. Trial results are based on a statistical analysis of study subjects who come down with Covid-19. If more people receiving the placebo than the vaccine become ill, then the vaccine is effective. The Pfizer and BioNTech results were based on 94 confirmed cases, making them more statistically compelling than the 20 cases in the Russian data. In the vaccine trial by Pfizer and BioNTech, half of the participants received two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart, and half received a placebo. The first analysis was based on 94 volunteers who had developed Covid-19. To calculate the efficacy rate, an independent board of experts compared how many of those 94 cases were in the placebo group, and how many were in the vaccinated group. (If all 94 had been in the placebo group, for example, the vaccine would be considered 100 percent effective.) Gamaleya Research Institute plans to test the two-shot vaccine on 40,000 people. So far, about 16,000 people have received both doses. Separately, the Russian Ministry of Health has vaccinated about 10,000 volunteers under the emergency use approval, according to the statement released on Wednesday.

The surging virus in the U.S. finds a federal leadership vacuum. President Trump has been relatively quiet about the virus. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times As President Trump pushes to overturn the results of the election while the pandemic rages on, his only public statements about the coronavirus in the last few days have been to make clear his pique that good news about a vaccine had not come until after Election Day. Meanwhile, the Strategic National Stockpile, the U.S. emergency reserve, has only 115 million N95 masks, far short of the 300 million the administration had hoped to amass by winter, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, who retired on Monday as the national supply chain commander, said in a recent interview, though he added that the government is continuing to expand its supplies of protective gear. The pandemic caught the nation flat-footed in March, but epidemiologists have been warning for months of a fall and winter wave as people are driven indoors, schools resume in-person classes and Americans grow tired of months of precautions. Yet shortages of personal protective equipment are back, especially among rural hospitals, nursing homes and private medical practices that lack access to the supply networks that serve larger hospital chains. Governors are once again competing with one another and big hospital chains for scarce gear. Nursing homes are grappling with staff shortages, which have left hospitals unable to discharge patients to their care. In the absence of leadership, local officials feel as if they are struggling alone. New weekly cases among nursing home residents jumped fourfold from the end of May to late October, and deaths have more than doubled in 20 states, according to R. Tamara Konetzka and Rebecca J. Gorges, researchers at the University of Chicago who analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even many large hospital chains, which say they have adequate supplies of medical gear, continue to operate in crisis mode.

N.Y. will limit private gatherings and require bars and restaurants to close daily at 10 p.m. Union Square in Manhattan on Monday. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times With coronavirus cases surging in New York and across the country, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that private indoor and outdoor gatherings statewide would be limited to 10 people and that gyms, bars and restaurants must close daily at 10 p.m. The restrictions will take effect Friday, and Mr. Cuomo said that local governments will be responsible for enforcing them. The limit on gatherings will apply to private homes. The curfew will apply only to bars and restaurants licensed by the state liquor authority, and restaurants can continue to provide takeout and delivery after 10 p.m., but only for food. Mr. Cuomo said that officials were moved to announce the new restrictions as they confronted an increase in cases. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties,” Mr. Cuomo said on a conference call with reporters. “That’s where it’s coming from, primarily.” After months when the New York City area had seemed to keep the pandemic relatively contained, the virus has again increased sharply in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the region that was once at the center of the U.S. outbreak. Though cases and hospitalizations are significantly lower than they were at the spring peak, officials in all three states have acknowledged that they are considering additional restrictions that would roll back the slow, cautious reopening process — particularly as cooling weather drives people indoors, where the virus more easily spreads. In a marked difference from the spring, the wave in the metropolitan area coincides with a surge nationwide. The United States has been shattering daily records for new cases, pushing the seven-day average to more than 123,000 per day, as of Tuesday, according to a New York Times database. For the first time, new cases surpassed 140,000 on Wednesday. And 65,368 people were hospitalized across the country with Covid-19 on Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, the largest number at any point during the pandemic. “And New York is a ship on the Covid tide,” Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that the citywide seven-day average rate of positive test results was at 2.52 percent — a rate last seen in early June, when the city had only just begun reopening nonessential business after a devastating spring that saw thousands die. “This is our LAST chance to stop a second wave,” Mr. de Blasio wrote on Twitter. “We can do it, but we have to act NOW.” Cases have since been rising across all five boroughs, including Staten Island, which has long bristled at virus-related limits. Over the past week, New York City has seen an average of 1,142 cases a day, a jump of 77 percent from just two weeks earlier. Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that parts of Staten Island would be designated a “yellow zone” in his color-coded tier system of restrictions, which requires more testing in schools. The state has also designated parts of Port Chester, a suburban community of about 29,000 in Westchester County on the border with Connecticut, as an “orange zone,” which closes schools for at least four days, limits capacity at religious institutions, bans indoor dining and closes high-risk businesses like gyms and hair salons. In New York State, the seven-day average rate of positive test results was 2.43 percent on Wednesday, the highest the figure has been since late May when the state was doing less testing than it is now. The state also reported 1,628 hospitalizations, its highest total since mid-June, though far short of the peak in April of more than 18,000. In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy has put new limits on indoor dining that begin Thursday night, in what he said was a bid to avoid the sweeping shutdowns that brought the region’s economy to a standstill in March. New Jersey’s coronavirus hospitalizations have more than doubled in the last month, from 653 to 1,801. The number of people hospitalized has also surged in Connecticut, to 548, the highest total since May 29, according to state data. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut has also limited all private gatherings in the state to 10 people, lowered capacity limits on restaurants and allowed the hardest-hit municipalities to reimpose limits on other businesses. —

The Ohio governor issues a mask mandate, joining other states that are implementing new restrictions. Wearing masks are now required at businesses in Ohio as new restrictions to prevent coronavirus infections go into effect. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Some have pleaded. Some cajoled. Some scolded. Some invoked the past, some the future. Since Election Day, more than one-third of the governors across the United States have issued public appeals for people to take coronavirus prevention measures seriously, as the number of cases and hospitalizations spike in most of the country. In a televised address, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio invoked the Veterans Day holiday on Wednesday, noting that previous generations had laid down their lives to protect the country. “Today we all must do something far less dramatic, but very important,” he said. “Wear a mask, so that your friends, neighbors and family members might live.” To put teeth into that admonition, the governor announced that stores would be closed for 24 hours if a team of inspectors found that workers or customers at any retailer ignored the mask rule two times. In other measures, he banned dancing and games at social gatherings, and said participants in banquets, weddings and funeral receptions could no longer congregate. If the numbers continued to mount, Gov. DeWine said, there would be new restrictions on bars, restaurants and gyms within a week, and universities would be asked to stick to remote learning in January. In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers made a similar prime-time speech on Tuesday night, advising residents to change their lives to help contain the virus. “It’s not safe to have others over — it’s just not safe,” Mr. Evers said, adding that virtual hangouts were better for the foreseeable future. “So please, cancel the happy hours, dinner parties, sleepovers and play dates at your home. ” Numerous governors warned that new mandatory measures, which many have avoided, might be coming if mounting case counts put severe pressure on medical facilities. In Nevada, Gov. Steve Sisolak cautioned residents that they had roughly 14 days to get in line. “Nevadans need to accept and understand this reality now, and change behaviors immediately,” he said at a news conference Tuesday. “In the next two weeks, we must see a significant reversal of the current trends, which are deeply concerning now.” Many governors have pleaded for patience, recognizing that combating Covid-19 has been a difficult slog. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, stressing the positive preliminary results that Pfizer announced on Monday for its experimental vaccine, said, “I hope the good news about a vaccine inspires us to double down on social distancing in Colorado.” Some governors appealed to patriotism, or unity, or protecting the family. In Idaho, where virus prevention measures have drawn protests about tyranny, Gov. Brad Little cited Veterans Day too. “Our veterans bravely encountered bullets and bombs so that you can have the freedom to control your own actions,” the governor wrote in an opinion piece. “And your personal actions are the one and only thing that will defend our veterans from succumbing to the enemy virus.” Inevitably some, including the governors of North Carolina, Iowa and Indiana, have imposed new measures in all or part of their states, often focused on indoor gatherings. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that private indoor and outdoor gatherings statewide would be limited to 10 people and that gyms, bars and restaurants must close nightly at 10 p.m. starting Friday. The Federal government got in the act too, with the National Park Service announcing this week that the 98th National Tree Lighting Ceremony would not include a live audience. The ceremony will be streamed at thenationaltree.org on Thursday, Dec. 3, and the tree on display there throughout the season. California is about to broach the one million case mark, a threshold reached only by Texas so far, with more than 996,000 cases as of Wednesday and a recent average of more than 6,400 cases a day. San Francisco has banned indoor dining again starting next Sunday, paused high school reopenings and limited gyms and movie theaters to 25 percent of capacity. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the state’s numbers “sobering” and predicted that they would probably climb with the onset of winter, in a “twindemic” of Covid-19 and flu. Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah took some of the most drastic recent measures, declaring a new state of emergency on Sunday and instituting a statewide mask mandate. One of the bluntest entreaties came in Maryland, which lowered the ceiling on indoor dining capacity to 50 percent of capacity Wednesday and capped indoor gatherings at 25 people. In a news conference last week, Gov. Larry Hogan warned against complacency. “I mean, it’s simple, it’s not that hard,” he said. “Just wear the damn masks.” —

Several hundred people gathered at the event in the East Room for several hours, many of them not wearing masks as they mingled and watched election returns. After another event at the White House — a celebration of Mr. Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Sept. 26 — more than a dozen aides, reporters and guests who were in attendance or came into contact with people who were there tested positive for the virus. —

Newark’s mayor imposes new restrictions as the city reaches a positivity rate of 19%. A line of customers order at Calandra’s Bakery in Newark on Wednesday, as the city operates under new restrictions because of a sharp increase of coronavirus cases. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Two weeks ago, as the coronavirus began to spread widely again in Newark, officials imposed New Jersey’s toughest new restrictions since the spring lockdown, mandating an 8 p.m. indoor closing time for all restaurants, bars and nonessential businesses citywide. But the number of new cases in Newark, the state’s largest city, kept climbing, with 842 new reported infections over the last four days. Of those people tested in Newark over three days last week, 19 percent were found to have the virus, city and county officials said — more than double the statewide rate, and almost eight times the rate in New York State. The uptick mirrors a spike in Covid-19 hospitalizations across New Jersey to levels not seen since June. On Tuesday, New Jersey recorded 3,777 new infections, the most since April — a figure the governor called “devastating.” Hospitals also reported 15 coronavirus deaths, adding to the state’s pandemic death toll of more than 16,400. Newark sits just a few miles west of New York City, where officials are struggling to contain a spike on Staten Island and bracing for a second wave of cases. Alarmed by the new data, Newark’s mayor, Ras J. Baraka, implemented a sweeping set of rules on Tuesday designed to avoid a repeat of the springtime outbreak. Mr. Baraka ordered a 9 p.m. weekday curfew for residents of three ZIP codes, and canceled all team sports activities citywide, effective immediately. He barred Newark’s nursing homes from accepting visitors for two weeks, and capped gatherings — indoors and outdoors — at 10 people until at least Dec. 1. Aides said Mr. Baraka would not hesitate to shut down businesses, issue fines and suspend liquor licenses if needed. The tough talk created tension between Gov. Philip D. Murphy and Mr. Baraka, allies and fellow Democrats. Mr. Murphy this week imposed a 10 p.m. closing time on restaurants and bars, among other restrictions, but he has resisted ordering a statewide lockdown.When asked about Newark’s rules, Mr. Murphy’s top lawyer, Parimal Garg, said that state law superseded municipal actions. Perry N. Halkitis, a dean of biostatistics and urban-global public health at the School of Public Health at Rutgers University,said that an emphasis on quelling indoor drinking during late-night hours, when inhibitions drop, was appropriate. He also said he was equally concerned about private indoor gatherings that are harder to monitor. “You really love your family?” said Dr. Halkitis. “For Thanksgiving, you should not be with them.” — Kevin Armstrong and

Wincing at high community case rates, major districts put off reopening schools. Princess Bryant, a Boston public school teacher, holds her kindergarten class via video-conference from her apartment. Credit... Brian Snyder/Reuters School officials in Philadelphia, San Diego, Minneapolis and several other large cities hit pause on their reopening plans this week, joining a number of districts across the United States that have delayed bringing students back to classrooms because of surging coronavirus cases. Washington and Boston have also reversed course on reopenings recently, and Chicago has not yet set a return date. Any school district that has not already reopened its classrooms is now facing significant headwinds to do so in 2020. Although research indicates that children are less likely than adults to spread the virus, many health experts say that schools cannot safely reopen while community transmission is rampant — even though remote schooling can carry a heavy social and economic cost. “Most of the country — when you look at the map, a lot of them have case rates that I would say are too high to open schools,” said Benjamin Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University. “It’s a crisis for public education.” There are many parts of the United States — including Florida, Texas and New York City — where schools are fully or partially open. Baltimore still plans to bring some students back to classrooms next week, though it has slashed the number of schools that will reopen. With the country posting record numbers of cases and hospitalizations, the window for reopening is closing rapidly. Much will depend on the course the pandemic takes over the next few months, as colder weather drives people to spend more time indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. Gatherings for Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holidays are also likely to sow new outbreaks. “If we put a plan in place and really try to control the epidemic, I think it’s possible that schools could stay open or reopen in January or February,” Dr. Linas said. “But that is going to require a national Covid strategy.” — Amelia Nierenberg and

These researchers tested positive for the coronavirus, but not because they were infected. Dr. Timothy Wannier, a researcher at Harvard University, came into contact with the coronavirus’s genetic material, which caused him to test positive for the disease without being infected. Credit... Adam Glanzman for The New York Times Scientists in at least half a dozen universities and research centers in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus — not because they were infected, but because they were studying the virus’s genetic material and that contaminated their tests. In recent months, labs around the country have begun research projects that involve the coronavirus’s genes, harmless hunks of molecules that pose no infectious threat. But those genes also happen to be the targets of several widely used coronavirus tests. Researchers who inadvertently inhale or touch the genetic material may be contaminating the swabs used to sample their airways, tricking tests into labeling them as infected, even when they are actually virus-free. Contaminated positives such as these are extremely rare, health experts said. People outside the research community should not worry about their own test results. Blame also should not be pinned on the test, which did its intended job of rooting out the virus’s genetic material. “This isn’t the fault of any test,” said Dr. Rosemary She, a pathologist and diagnostics expert at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the contamination events. “This is human error.” But in a nation with a patchwork approach to testing, and where a great many researchers have rapidly pivoted to studying the coronavirus, contaminations are occurring with unexpected frequency. These issues have struck labs at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown University, Roger Williams University, Cornell University and elsewhere, delivering puzzling results to anxious scientists, prompting building closures and fueling frustration with tests — which could cause people to avoid taking them altogether, damaging efforts to keep the virus in check. “We’ve never had a situation where so many labs work on a pathogen” amid a pandemic and had so much asymptomatic testing, said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of California who was not involved in the contamination events. As a result, there are few contingency plans in place to deal with such unusual testing errors. Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against retesting people within 90 days of a positive result. There are no explicit exceptions for potential contamination. Many individuals whose tests were likely contaminated, across several institutions, stopped getting tested for weeks or months because their positive results had been treated as legitimate, despite the possibility they were still vulnerable to the virus. Without more flexibility in their policies to account for these unusual testing errors, Dr. Butler-Wu said, states and universities could soon “have an outbreak on their hands.” —

Two new studies by the U.S. Navy confirm the need for strict coronavirus testing protocols. Marine recruits training on an obstacle course at Parris Island Recruit Depot, S.,C., in May. Credit... Lolita Baldor/Associated Press Young, healthy people who contract the coronavirus are often asymptomatic, very rarely need hospital care and can transmit the virus to a roommate unwittingly even when following strict quarantine orders, according to two new studies from the U.S. Navy. The findings support the need for strong measures, like daily testing, that go beyond the temperature checks and symptom reporting now commonly deployed to prevent transmission in offices, dormitories and other group settings, the authors said. “These findings all point to the need for ongoing testing strategies,” said Dr. Andrew G. Letizia, a commander and infectious disease specialist at the Naval Medical Research Center, in Silver Spring, Md., and lead author of one of the studies. “We need to augment public health measures and reinforce them with regular testing” in such settings. The new reports, both posted Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine, clarify much of what is known or suspected about the coronavirus’s effect on young adults, while also exposing the limits of quarantine measures. One study, led by Dr. Letizia, detailed the rate of new infections detected among nearly 2,000 recruits under quarantine near Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot, in South Carolina, over the summer. It was conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The other report described an outbreak on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier on which nearly a quarter of the crew — more than 1,200 seamen and women — tested positive last spring. “The approaches learned from the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt and Parris Island can be applied, with varying degrees of relevance, to land-based shared living situations,” wrote Dr. Nelson L. Michael, of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, in an accompanying editorial, “such as college dormitories, prisons, and residential care facilities, as well as sports training environments, meat-processing facilities, and isolated energy plants.” —

Disease experts see Covid-19 trends worsening in the U.S. Tents for patients who tested positive for Covid-19 outside of a hospital in El Paso on Tuesday. Credit... Joel Angel Juarez for The New York Times Infectious disease experts warned on Wednesday that the surge in coronavirus cases in many parts of the United States is likely to get much worse over the next few weeks. And despite the recent promising news about a vaccine by the drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech, wide distribution of a vaccine will take time. “It’s helpful to know there is an end in sight, but that end is not going to appear magically in January, February or March,” said Dr. Andrew Pavia, an infectious disease specialist at University of Utah School of Medicine, at a news conference by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on Wednesday about the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas. “That end is next summer or fall,” Dr. Pavia said. “That’s a hard message to give, but it’s critical.” On Monday, Pfizer said an early analysis of its vaccine trial found the vaccine to be more than 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19. But that initial finding could change as the trial goes on. Dr. Pavia noted that in his region, the Mountain West, the health care system was already strained as the holiday season loomed. “The situation in the hospitals is going to be quite a bit worse in the next two to three weeks than it is today,” he said. “If Thanksgiving does the same thing to us that Memorial Day did and Labor Day did, and people gather, as we all want to do, without taking precautions, we could see another acceleration going into Christmas.” He noted that even if a vaccine is approved soon, people must continue to rely on masks and social distancing for months to come, because initial vaccine supplies will be limited and will be reserved for health care workers and other front line workers. Dr. Pavia and Dr. Daniel McQuillen, who is the president-elect of the association, called for an end to the politicization of the pandemic, and for leaders to send a clear, consistent message backed by scientific data to promote health precautions that can be taken by individuals. Dr. McQuillen said public health agencies and political leaders, including President Trump, “need to tell the truth, and tell people what the reality is and how we’re going to get out of it, without any sugarcoating.” Dr. Pavia added: “We have to take politics out of this. Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, you’re susceptible to the virus, and masks work just as well.” —

Maryland football halts all activities and cancels game against Ohio State after players test positive. Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa during a game against Minnesota on Oct. 30. Credit... Julio Cortez/Associated Press The University of Maryland halted its football-related activities on Wednesday and canceled its game this weekend against Ohio State after eight players tested positive for the virus within the past seven days. “We realize that this news is disappointing to all of the Maryland fans out there who were looking forward to the Terps taking on an outstanding Ohio State team, but the responsible thing for us to do is pause football activities,” said Damon Evans, Maryland’s athletic director, in the announcement. Michael Locksley, the team’s coach, said it would continue to meet virtually while in-person activities were on pause. The cancellation means three out of the top five teams in The Associated Press Top 25 poll will be sidelined this weekend because of the virus. The University of Alabama, ranked No. 1, was scheduled to play Louisiana State University before positive test results among L.S.U. players prompted the Southeastern Conference to postpone the game. Texas A&M, ranked No. 5, was supposed to play at the University of Tennessee but had to stop practicing after several members of their organization tested positive for the virus on Monday. In total, four SEC games set for this weekend were delayed because of positive tests across programs. “Numbers around contact tracing have emerged as one of our biggest challenges to playing,” said SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey in a call with reporters Wednesday. “Adjustments have to continually be made.” The Big Ten, unlike the SEC and some other conferences, planned to not reschedule games this season that cannot be played because of the pandemic. —

South Africa will lift restrictions on all international travel. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript South Africa Will Lift International Travel Restrictions President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa announced Wednesday that the country will open its borders to all international travelers despite an increasing number of coronavirus cases in some parts of the country. The Covid-19 U.I.F. scheme has already paid out nearly 53 billion to over 4.7 million workers. These relief measures were necessary to protect those who are most vulnerable in a time of great distress. But they will have to come to an end as we do not, as a government, have sufficient resources to continue. As we transition to a new phase in our response, the only way forward is a rapid and sustained economic recovery. We are, therefore, working to enable all parts of our economy to return to full operation as quickly and as safely as possible. We are amending the Alert Level 1 regulations to restore normal trading hours, for instance, for the sale of alcohol at retail outlets. We are also opening up international travel to all countries subject to the necessary health protocols and the presentation of a negative Covid-19 certificate. Now by utilizing rapid tests and strict monitoring, we intend to limit the spread of the infection through importation by those who will be traveling to our country. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa announced Wednesday that the country will open its borders to all international travelers despite an increasing number of coronavirus cases in some parts of the country. Credit Credit... Nic Bothma/EPA, via Shutterstock South Africa will open its borders to all international travelers, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Wednesday, even as the number of new coronavirus cases rises in some parts of the country, leaving some officials concerned that a rollback on travel restrictions could invite a second wave. “We are also opening up international travel to all countries subject to the necessary health protocols and the presentation of a negative Covid-19 certificate,” said Mr. Ramaphosa during an address to the country. He did not say when the new rules would replace a current, lengthy no-fly list that bans tourists from dozens of European countries and the United States. The announcement came ahead of what would normally be the beginning of peak tourist season, when colder weather in the northern hemisphere starts luring up to 10 million foreigners to the country’s pristine beaches and game safaris. South Africa has recorded more than 740,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 20,000 deaths since the spring, according to a New York Times database. Cases have dropped from a high of 12,000 new daily infections in July to fewer than 2,000 a day for the past three months. Still, localized spikes in cases have worried officials for several weeks, including in the Eastern Cape province and in Cape Town, a major tourist destination. The government also declared five days of mourning for victims of the pandemic and for women and children who are victims of violence. South Africa has one of the world’s highest rates of violence against women, which Mr. Ramaphosa called a “second pandemic.” He said the national flag would fly at half-mast, and urged all citizens to wear black armbands on Nov. 25. —

GLOBAL ROUNDUP Lebanon will lock down again, and other news from around the world. A virus testing site in Haret Hreik, south of Beirut, in October. Credit... Xinhua News Agency Lebanon is imposing a new lockdown that will shut many businesses and limit road traffic as the small Mediterranean country tries to limit a spike in coronavirus cases that has stretched hospital resources. The new lockdown, which the government announced on Tuesday, will begin Saturday and last until Nov. 30. Many businesses and government offices will close, cars will be allowed on the road on alternate days based on the last number of their license plates and a nighttime curfew will be enforced, although its hours have yet to be decided. While the measures have been billed as a “total lockdown,” the country’s sea, air and land borders will remain open, as will establishments deemed “essential,” such as pharmacies, bakeries, banks and electricity and communications facilities. Lebanon, a small, beleaguered country of 5.4 million bordered by Syria and Israel, reported surprisingly low infection numbers early in the pandemic, mostly because of a strict early lockdown that included an airport closure. But cases have risen steadily in recent months, as have virus-related deaths, a rise that medical workers have blamed on spotty mask-wearing and lax observance of social distancing guidelines. The new lockdown comes amid an economic crisis that has seen unemployment spike and the currency lose about 80 percent of its value against the United States dollar since last year. A huge explosion in the Beirut port in August killed nearly 200 people and caused billions of dollars in damages. Since February, 96,907 people have contracted the virus and 749 people have died in connection to the virus, according to a Times database. In other developments around the world: Spain’s government announced Wednesday that it would require travelers arriving in Spain from high-risk countries to prove they tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours before landing. The order, which goes into effect Nov. 23, has long been demanded by some regional politicians, particularly in Madrid, whose regional leader, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has blamed untested travelers arriving at Madrid’s airport for helping to spread the virus in the capital region.

Singapore and Hong Kong said that a travel bubble between the two Asian financial centers will begin this month, allowing travelers to bypass quarantine. The arrangement, set to begin on Nov. 22, would allow one designated “bubble” flight into each city every day, each carrying a maximum of 200 passengers. Travelers must test negative for the virus and fly only on the designated flights.

The European Union’s executive arm proposed a “European Health Union” in a bid to coordinate a patchwork of Covid-19 measures across the bloc and centralize responses to the pandemic. The proposal by the European Commission, which would need to be approved by the European Parliament and member countries, would create an E.U.-wide plan to prepare for future health crises, as well as coordinate Covid-19 testing across the bloc. — Ben Hubbard, Raphael Minder, Tiffany May and

The risk of dying from Covid-19 is higher for people with intellectual disabilities. A testing site in Milwaukee last week. People with intellectual disabilities are vulnerable to the virus for several reason Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times People with intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders are three times as likely to die from Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, compared with other people who contract the disease, according to a large analysis of insurance claims data. The finding raises complex questions about how new vaccines should be allocated when they become available in limited supplies. So far, the guidelines for distributing vaccines in the U.S. have recommended giving first priority to workers in emergency services, health care and other essential roles, as well as people who are at heightened risk for severe disease if they become infected, including some older adults and those with certain chronic illnesses. The guidelines, which are still evolving, have not specifically emphasized vaccinating children and adults with intellectual disabilities like Down syndrome and developmental disorders. The new analysis was performed by FAIR Health, a nonprofit group that claims to host the nation’s largest private health insurance claims database, in collaboration with Dr. Marty Makary, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the West Health Institute, a group of nonprofit organizations focused on aging and on lowering health care costs for older people. The analysis was evaluated only by an academic reviewer, and it has not been published in a scientific journal. “There has always been some hesitancy to treat people with intellectual disabilities and people who are institutionalized as equal, in terms of consideration for scarce medical resources — and that also includes prisoners, by the way,” said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “There will be some balking and battling, on grounds that I would consider discriminatory.” People with intellectual disabilities are vulnerable to the virus for several reasons. Many live in group homes or receive care from aides, therapists or teachers who must be in close physical proximity in order to assist them. And many are medically frail to begin with, with high rates of other underlying health conditions, particularly respiratory problems. “Historically, it’s been a challenge for this population to receive good medical care,” said Scott Landes, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University. “If you’ve got someone whose cognitive ability is severely reduced, just understanding what’s going on and why they have to wear a mask would be very confusing.” —

Russia’s vaccine proves effective in early trial data, company says. A nurse giving a volunteer a coronavirus vaccine in Moscow in September. Credit... Natalia Kolesnikova/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Russia’s coronavirus vaccine has shown strong effectiveness in early data from a clinical trial, according to a statement on Wednesday from the Russian financial company promoting the shot. The Russian Direct Investment Fund said that the vaccine, called Sputnik V, demonstrated 92 percent efficacy, based on results from 20 people in the trial who developed Covid-19 after getting either the experimental vaccine or a placebo shot. Because few scientific details were given, independent vaccine experts could not fully assess its veracity. “It’s very hard to say much with 20 cases and no other details,” said Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University. The scientists behind the Russian vaccine have not released the trial blueprints, known as protocols, which are needed for a thorough review of the data. The Russian developer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, plans to publish details of the interim results in a peer-reviewed article, the Russian Direct Investment Fund said in its statement. The results are not implausible, especially considering the news from earlier in the week that Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was “more than 90 percent effective” in preventing the illness. Like all vaccines now in clinical trials, the Pfizer and Sputnik V vaccines present a coronavirus protein called “spike” to the immune system. Because Pfizer’s data was so strong, “it boosts my confidence in other vaccines as well,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida who specializes in infectious disease outbreaks. There are now 11 vaccines in late-stage clinical trials worldwide, including three in Russia. Since August, Russia has sought to get ahead in the global race to market vaccines by announcing its product was effective before clinical trials showed that to be the case, and by approving it for emergency use at home. China has also approved a vaccine for emergency use before its trials are completed. The World Health Organization rebuked Russia for skipping steps in the approval process. Trial results are based on a statistical analysis of study subjects who come down with Covid-19. If more people receiving the placebo than the vaccine become ill, then the vaccine is effective. The Pfizer and BioNTech results were based on 94 confirmed cases, making them more statistically compelling than the 20 cases in the Russian data. In the vaccine trial by Pfizer and BioNTech, half of the participants received two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart, and half received a placebo. The first analysis was based on 94 volunteers who had developed Covid-19. To calculate the efficacy rate, an independent board of experts compared how many of those 94 cases were in the placebo group, and how many were in the vaccinated group. (If all 94 had been in the placebo group, for example, the vaccine would be considered 100 percent effective.) Gamaleya Research Institute plans to test the two-shot vaccine on 40,000 people. So far, about 16,000 people have received both doses. Separately, the Russian Ministry of Health has vaccinated about 10,000 volunteers under the emergency use approval, according to the statement released on Wednesday.

The surging virus in the U.S. finds a federal leadership vacuum. President Trump has been relatively quiet about the virus. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times As President Trump pushes to overturn the results of the election while the pandemic rages on, his only public statements about the coronavirus in the last few days have been to make clear his pique that good news about a vaccine had not come until after Election Day. Meanwhile, the Strategic National Stockpile, the U.S. emergency reserve, has only 115 million N95 masks, far short of the 300 million the administration had hoped to amass by winter, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, who retired on Monday as the national supply chain commander, said in a recent interview, though he added that the government is continuing to expand its supplies of protective gear. The pandemic caught the nation flat-footed in March, but epidemiologists have been warning for months of a fall and winter wave as people are driven indoors, schools resume in-person classes and Americans grow tired of months of precautions. Yet shortages of personal protective equipment are back, especially among rural hospitals, nursing homes and private medical practices that lack access to the supply networks that serve larger hospital chains. Governors are once again competing with one another and big hospital chains for scarce gear. Nursing homes are grappling with staff shortages, which have left hospitals unable to discharge patients to their care. In the absence of leadership, local officials feel as if they are struggling alone. New weekly cases among nursing home residents jumped fourfold from the end of May to late October, and deaths have more than doubled in 20 states, according to R. Tamara Konetzka and Rebecca J. Gorges, researchers at the University of Chicago who analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even many large hospital chains, which say they have adequate supplies of medical gear, continue to operate in crisis mode. That often means requiring employees to repeatedly reuse respirator masks that are meant to be discarded after each use. — Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Noah Weiland, Sharon LaFraniere and



Dollar nurses losses amid worries about second coronavirus wave, Biden transition - Reuters UKThe dollar nursed losses on Tuesday as a return of coronavirus restrictions in some U.S. states and worries about a smooth transition for President-elect Joe Biden offset optimism about a coronavirus vaccine.NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a one-week low on Tuesday in quiet trading, still weighed down by optimism over a second coronavirus vaccine, as the outlook for the currency remained downbeat with the Federal Reserve and U.S. Congress poised to do more to ease COVID-19’s economic damage.

The euro, sterling, Swiss franc, and yen rose against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan hit its highest against the U.S. currency since June 2018.

Drugmaker Moderna MRNA.O became the second U.S. pharmaceutical company in a week to report positive results from trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, considered necessary to eradicate the pandemic.

Policymakers’ response to a record number of coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths in several U.S. states is likely to remain of greater concern.

“The key story is still about COVID-19 and the short-term pressures it’s going to put not just on the U.S, but abroad. And it’s going to force Congress or the Federal Reserve to do more,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

“Whether we get a stimulus after (President-elect) Joe Biden takes office or whether the Fed does more, the trajectory for the dollar is pretty clear: it’s going to be much lower.”

In afternoon trading, the dollar index =USD fell to a one-week low against a basket of major currencies, and last stood at 92.426, down 0.1%.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the Fed is committed to “using all of our tools to support the recovery for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.” He made the comments at a virtual event hosted by the Bay Area Council in California.

Amo Sahota, executive director at currency advisory firm Klarity FX in San Francisco, said central bankers are “trying to recalibrate market expectations about a post-COVID world.”

He added that Powell has indicated that “once we’re through this COVID period and we have a vaccine, we’re not going to have the same economy as before.”

Data showing U.S. retail sales rising less than expected in October had minimal dollar impact. Retail sales rose 0.3% last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.5% in October.

Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.4% to 104.20 JPY=EBS, while the euro inched higher by 0.1% to $1.1862 EUR=EBS.

The euro, sterling, Swiss franc, and yen rose against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan hit its highest against the U.S. currency since June 2018.

Drugmaker Moderna MRNA.O became the second U.S. pharmaceutical company in a week to report positive results from trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, considered necessary to eradicate the pandemic.

Policymakers’ response to a record number of coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths in several U.S. states is likely to remain of greater concern.

“The key story is still about COVID-19 and the short-term pressures it’s going to put not just on the U.S, but abroad. And it’s going to force Congress or the Federal Reserve to do more,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

“Whether we get a stimulus after (President-elect) Joe Biden takes office or whether the Fed does more, the trajectory for the dollar is pretty clear: it’s going to be much lower.”

In afternoon trading, the dollar index =USD fell to a one-week low against a basket of major currencies, and last stood at 92.426, down 0.1%.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the Fed is committed to “using all of our tools to support the recovery for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.” He made the comments at a virtual event hosted by the Bay Area Council in California.

Amo Sahota, executive director at currency advisory firm Klarity FX in San Francisco, said central bankers are “trying to recalibrate market expectations about a post-COVID world.”

He added that Powell has indicated that “once we’re through this COVID period and we have a vaccine, we’re not going to have the same economy as before.”

(Reuters) - The race to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus is entering a critical stretch, with several candidates that were first out of the gate beginning to release late-stage trial data.

Pfizer Inc PFE.N and its partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F said on Monday their experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, a much higher efficacy rate than the 50% minimum required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Multiple vaccines are likely to make it to market and success will depend on a number of factors, including immune response, safety and distribution.

The health secretary warned the breakthrough Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at a very cold temperature, restricting possible administration points to those with the necessary facilities. He made the confession during an appearance on the BBC’s Question Time show on Thursday evening.

Question Time host Fiona Bruce asked: “This is complicated isn’t it because you need these super freezers, that keep it at minus 70 degrees. “The Scottish Government has already brought some of these super freezers. “Are you going to be able to pull this off?” In response Mr Hancock replied: “Yes.

"It is a challenge - it is incredibly difficult"

“The UK Government is buying this vaccine and the other vaccines, and it’s important in our portfolio we have several, and we’re buying them for the whole UK. “Then the NHS in each country; in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, is responsible for the deployment. It is a challenge, it is incredibly difficult.” On Monday Pfizer said preliminary tests show the vaccine they have been producing with BioNTech successfully protects 90 percent of people from catching coronavirus.

Pfizer said they hope to supply 50 million doses of their vaccine this year and 1.3 billion next year.

As each patient needs to take the vaccine twice this would allow ten million people to be inoculated. Under the deal agreed the UK will receive vaccines from Pfizer next year.

Speaking to the BBC John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said the vaccine appears to offer “an amazing level of efficacy”. However other experts have said they will reserve judgement until more data from the tests is released by Pfizer. Boris Johnson welcomed the vaccine news but warned Britons not to reduce their vigilance.

</li><li>P…BEIJING: Nearly one million people have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) through the country’s emergency use programme, the firm said late on Wednesday.

China launched the emergency use programme in July, which so far includes three vaccine candidates for essential workers and other limited groups of people even as clinical studies have yet to be completed to prove their safety and efficacy.

No serious adverse reaction has been reported from those who received the vaccine in emergency use, Sinopharm said in an article on social media WeChat, citing Chairman Liu Jingzhen from a recent media interview.

Two vaccine candidates developed by Sinopharm’s subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and third one developed by Sinovac Biotech have been used for the emergency programme.

It’s unclear which vaccine Liu referred to, and Sinopharm was not immediately available to comment.

Sinopharm’s vaccines, which use inactivated virus unable to replicate in human cells to trigger immune responses, require two doses, clinical trial registration data showed.

The experimental vaccines are undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials overseas that have recruited nearly 60,000 people, and blood samples of more than 40,000 participants have been taken 14 days after they took the second dose, the article said citing Liu, without breaking down the numbers for each vaccine.

Among construction project employees, diplomats and students who went abroad after taking Sinopharm’s vaccine, no one has been infected, it added.

But experts have cautioned against using data solely from emergency use programme, without comparable results from a clinical trial-standard control group, to determine a vaccine’s effectiveness.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday he hopes to see COVID-19 vaccines roll out in Canada early next year, but warned that won't bring an immediate resolution to the pandemic currently seeing a resurgence in several provinces.

The prime minister said news from Pfizer that one of its vaccine candidates appears very effective in clinical trials is “very encouraging” but won't help anyone who catches the virus in the meantime.

Speaking in Ottawa, Trudeau said other vaccine candidates have also appeared to progress well, and Canada has secured access to several, given the uncertainty regarding which will be ready first, which will be more effective with certain populations, and other variables.

When a vaccine is safe to distribute, the government will begin dispensing it to high-priority groups first, he said.

“We hope to see vaccines landing in the early next year but between now and then it's really, really important that we double down on our efforts,” Trudeau said.

“We need to make sure we are controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the coming months so that when vaccines get here we will be able to act quickly to protect all Canadians.”

His comments came after a weekend that saw the two provinces hardest hit by the pandemic report record-breaking daily case counts.

Quebec and Ontario reported 1,397 and 1,328 new cases respectively on Sunday, followed by 1,169 and 1,242 on Monday.

Health officials in Quebec said Monday that while the situation has improved in some parts of the province, such as Quebec City and Montreal, it is worsening in others - including the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean area, which currently has more than double the provincial rate of cases per 100,000 people.

Public health authorities reported 94 new cases in the region on Monday, for a total of 312 active cases per 100,000 people.

The region was placed under Quebec's highest COVID-19 alert level on Nov. 2, and the province's health minister said it will take some time before any effects from the new restrictions are seen.

In Ontario, Premier Doug Ford was asked Monday whether the ballooning cases in the province pushed him to reconsider its new colour-coded system for pandemic measures, which loosened public health restrictions in all regions but Toronto when it took effect Saturday.

The tiered system places health units in colour-coded categories based on their caseload and transmission levels, and has drawn criticism for allowing activities such as indoor dining in restaurants in all alert levels short of a lockdown.

In Peel Region, the only area currently in the red category, local health officials imposed additional measures over the weekend in order to reduce the risk of transmission.

But Ford defended the system Monday, saying it was built to give each region the flexibility to enact further rules, as Peel did. “That's the reason we have the framework,” he said.

Toronto, meanwhile, is remaining under a previous, more stringent system until the end of the week, at the request of local officials. The city accounted for 483 of Ontario's new cases on Monday.

Mayor John Tory said the city would likely follow in Peel Region's footsteps and impose “an enhanced suite of measures” to stem the spread of the virus, with more details to come Tuesday.

The city's top doctor, Dr. Eileen de Villa, said the COVID-19 numbers seen over the last few days were among the “most concerning” she's seen since the start of the pandemic.

Further west, Manitoba reported 365 new COVID-19 cases Monday as it continued to lead the country in per-capita active cases.

Chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin said the province is at a critical point in time, pointing to increased strain on the health system.

Roussin said he has talked with Premier Brian Pallister about imposing further restrictions.

Meanwhile, Trudeau said the federal government is already working on the logistics of distributing a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly since the Pfizer candidate needs to be stored at around -75C to remain stable.

Canada has bought the rights to 20 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine, if it proves effective and Health Canada approves it for use here, and Trudeau said the government would purchase more if the initial round goes well.

The company said in a news release that early results from a large-scale trial show its vaccine is 90 per cent effective at combating the virus.

Preliminary research out this month may provide you with a bit more incentive to get the flu vaccine. It found evidence that flu vaccination led to a lowered risk of getting covid-19 among health care workers in the Netherlands. Though not definitive, the study isn’t the first to suggest that certain vaccines can provide minor, nonspecific protection against infectious diseases not targeted by the vaccine, possibly including covid-19.

The research paper was released on the preprint website medRxiv in mid-October by scientists from the Netherlands and Germany. In it, they detail two separate investigations of the theory that the flu vaccine used in the Netherlands last winter—an inactivated vaccine meant to protect against the four main strains of the influenza virus in circulation—could lower the risk of covid-19. In many countries, including the U. S. , this is the primary type of flu vaccine used annually.

The basic idea is that some vaccines can not only train the parts of the immune system meant to recognize a specific germ‚ known as the adaptive immune system, but also temporarily boost the effectiveness of our innate immune system. The innate immune system uses a wide array of weapons to repel all sorts of invading germs, making it one of the body’s first lines of defense against unfamiliar microbial threats. A vaccine, it’s thought, can briefly keep the innate immune system more alert and ready to stop the next germ that crosses its way. Scientists call this theoretical boost “trained immunity.”

In the lab, the researchers found that human immune cells first exposed to the flu vaccine seemed to form a trained immune response to the coronavirus behind covid-19, compared to a control group of cells. In Dutch hospitals, they found that hospital workers who were vaccinated with last winter’s flu vaccine had a lower risk of being diagnosed with covid-19 than workers who didn’t get vaccinated.

“In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against covid-19,” they wrote.

The results have yet to go through the peer review process, meaning they should be viewed with some extra caution. And though this study’s authors do provide two lines of evidence for their conclusions, neither is clear proof that a flu vaccine will protect you from covid-19. There are other possible explanations for why Dutch hospital workers who took a flu shot may have been less likely to get covid-19 , for instance. It could be that these workers are extra cautious about catching any contagious illness—a personality trait that would both nudge them to get vaccinated for the flu and to avoid situations where covid-19 is likelier to spread.

There are ongoing clinical trials testing out whether the BCG vaccine and others can provide some short-term protection from covid-19—trials that will hopefully give us a clear answer one way or the other. In the meantime, though, getting vaccinated against the flu is already one of the most helpful things you can do for yourself and your community this winter.

Preliminary research out this month may provide you with a bit more incentive to get the flu vaccine. It found evidence that flu vaccination led to a lowered risk of getting covid-19 among health care workers in the Netherlands. Though not definitive, the study isn’t the first to suggest that certain vaccines can provide minor, nonspecific protection against infectious diseases not targeted by the vaccine, possibly including covid-19.

The research paper was released on the preprint website medRxiv in mid-October by scientists from the Netherlands and Germany. In it, they detail two separate investigations of the theory that the flu vaccine used in the Netherlands last winter—an inactivated vaccine meant to protect against the four main strains of the influenza virus in circulation—could lower the risk of covid-19. In many countries, including the U. S. , this is the primary type of flu vaccine used annually.

The basic idea is that some vaccines can not only train the parts of the immune system meant to recognize a specific germ‚ known as the adaptive immune system, but also temporarily boost the effectiveness of our innate immune system. The innate immune system uses a wide array of weapons to repel all sorts of invading germs, making it one of the body’s first lines of defense against unfamiliar microbial threats. A vaccine, it’s thought, can briefly keep the innate immune system more alert and ready to stop the next germ that crosses its way. Scientists call this theoretical boost “trained immunity.”

In the lab, the researchers found that human immune cells first exposed to the flu vaccine seemed to form a trained immune response to the coronavirus behind covid-19, compared to a control group of cells. In Dutch hospitals, they found that hospital workers who were vaccinated with last winter’s flu vaccine had a lower risk of being diagnosed with covid-19 than workers who didn’t get vaccinated.

“In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against covid-19,” they wrote.

The results have yet to go through the peer review process, meaning they should be viewed with some extra caution. And though this study’s authors do provide two lines of evidence for their conclusions, neither is clear proof that a flu vaccine will protect you from covid-19. There are other possible explanations for why Dutch hospital workers who took a flu shot may have been less likely to get covid-19 , for instance. It could be that these workers are extra cautious about catching any contagious illness—a personality trait that would both nudge them to get vaccinated for the flu and to avoid situations where covid-19 is likelier to spread.

Panama greenlights funds to buy AstraZeneca's planned coronavirus vaccine - ReutersPanama's government has authorized spending of $4.3 million to purchase 1.09 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Britain's AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, the president's office said on Wednesday.FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, "COVID-19 / Coronavirus vaccine / Injection only" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama’s government has authorized spending of $4.3 million to purchase 1.09 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, the president’s office said on Wednesday.

The Central American nation has been working on multiple Covid-19 vaccine options for its population of 4.2 million, with President Laurentino Cortizo saying he wants to guarantee that each resident will have access to two doses.

Last week, the government approved spending $48 million to buy 4 million doses of a vaccine being developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and its partner BioNTech of Germany.

The government in September also signed up for the World Health Organization-backed COVAX plan - a multilateral initiative running trials on several potential vaccines - from which it expects to receive some 1.3 million doses.

The country has been hard hit by the global pandemic, with nearly 150,000 confirmed infections and around 3,000 dead.Panama greenlights funds to buy AstraZeneca's planned coronavirus vaccine - ReutersPanama's government has authorized spending of $4.3 million to purchase 1.09 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Britain's AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, the president's office said on Wednesday.FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, "COVID-19 / Coronavirus vaccine / Injection only" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

Cuba leads race for Latin American coronavirus vaccine - ReutersAs Latin American nations test experimental coronavirus vaccines from across the globe and economic heavyweights such as Brazil and Mexico jockey for supply deals with major drugmakers, Communist-run Cuba already has two of its own vaccines in clinical trials.HAVANA (Reuters) - As Latin American nations test experimental coronavirus vaccines from across the globe and economic heavyweights such as Brazil and Mexico jockey for supply deals with major drugmakers, Communist-run Cuba already has two of its own vaccines in clinical trials.

Should its efforts succeed, the Caribbean island could become an important supplier to neighboring countries that might otherwise struggle to access vaccine supply as wealthy Western nations rush to secure doses, regional experts said.

“Cuba’s contribution with its vaccine could be very important for certain vulnerable groups in our region” such as the elderly, or remote indigenous communities, Jose Moya, the representative in Cuba for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), told Reuters.

If a Cuban vaccine proves safe and effective, it would become available for purchase in the region through PAHO, the Americas regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO), Moya said.

Cuba’s vaccine progress is being tracked by COVAX - a program co-led by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to ensure global distribution of vaccines - he said.

Cuba’s two vaccine candidates – known as Sovereign 1 and Sovereign 2 – are not among the nine COVAX has chosen for its portfolio to date, a CEPI spokesman said.

Vaccines are seen as crucial to ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 1.2 million lives and battered the world’s economy. There were 47 coronavirus vaccines in WHO-approved clinical trials as of Nov. 3, a handful in most advanced testing.

Cuba has long exported vaccines to the developing world, including shots against meningitis and hepatitis B, although data on recent sales is not public.

Late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro backed a home-grown biotech sector in the 1980s, partly so Cuba could become more self-sufficient in the face of a U.S. trade embargo. It has since become a major part of the economy.

Cuba’s vaccine program has drawn interest from ally Venezuela, whose president, Nicolas Maduro, said in August that the ALBA bloc of eight leftist Latin American and Caribbean countries backed it.

Other Latin American nations are prioritizing deals with major drugmakers and considering vaccines also in advanced testing from China and Russia.

Mexico’s foreign ministry told Reuters in August it planned to approach Cuba about its vaccine. As of last month, the ministry said those talks had not advanced.

The Addis Ababa-based Africa CDC said Cuba has a good scientific reputation and signaled potential interest once data on its vaccines become available.

Cuba will favor exports to countries with which it has existing healthcare agreements, after ensuring it has enough for its own needs, a health official told the journal MEDICC Review.

“We are making a big effort to be able to start vaccinating all the Cuban population in the first half of next year,” said Vicente Vérez, director of the Finlay Institute, Cuba’s foremost vaccine research center, during a visit by President Miguel Diaz-Canel last month.

VACCINE KNOW HOW

Scientists are hailed as heroes in Cuba, a prestige that helps limit brain drain despite low salaries and difficult conditions, as Cuban researchers contend with U.S. sanctions that hamper international collaboration and the purchase of supplies.

State-run media have run lengthy profiles of researchers working at Finlay, one of 20 research centers and 32 companies employing some 20,000 people that make up the state-run BioCubaFarma corporation.

Cuba produces 8 of the 12 vaccines in its national immunization program and has exported hundreds of millions of vaccines to more than 40 countries, according to BioCubaFarma President Eduardo Martinez.

Finlay’s Sovereign 1 and Sovereign 2 vaccines are being tested in hundreds and scores of people, respectively. Officials have not said when they expect to start pivotal trials involving thousands of volunteers.

Both vaccines target a part of the spike protein of the novel coronavirus called the receptor binding domain, which helps the virus stick to cells.

Sovereign 1 has generated antibodies blocking infection in rats and rabbits, and has so far proven safe in midstage human trials.

Cuba said last week it expects to have two more experimental COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials by year end, including one administered through the nose to immunize mucous membranes - a key entry point for the virus.

A diversified portfolio would help Cuba match the best type of vaccine to the appropriate population groups, BioCubaFarma’s Martinez said.

POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL HURDLES

Cuba’s ambitions may be challenged when researchers are ready to launch late-stage trials. Vaccines are more easily tested in places with rampant virus spread, but Cuba’s transmission rate is very low, with just about 500 confirmed active cases.

Political tensions with neighbors like Brazil may make it harder for Cuban researchers to find trial sites abroad.

Foreign ministry officials in Argentina and Mexico, which are hosting late-stage trials for several vaccines, said they were not aware of talks with Cuba.

Cash-strapped Cuba may also struggle to buy raw materials for large-scale vaccine production.

It could rely on other countries to handle manufacturing, said Jose Luis Di Fabio, a former PAHO vaccine coordinator and Cuba representative.

“By using prior expertise,” said Maria Bottazzi, co-leader of a vaccine development team at Houston’s Baylor College of Medicine, “the Cubans have created two vaccines that sound technologically quite promising.”Cuba leads race for Latin American coronavirus vaccine - ReutersAs Latin American nations test experimental coronavirus vaccines from across the globe and economic heavyweights such as Brazil and Mexico jockey for supply deals with major drugmakers, Communist-run Cuba already has two of its own vaccines in clinical trials.HAVANA (Reuters) - As Latin American nations test experimental coronavirus vaccines from across the globe and economic heavyweights such as Brazil and Mexico jockey for supply deals with major drugmakers, Communist-run Cuba already has two of its own vaccines in clinical trials.

Vaccines are seen as crucial to ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 1.2 million lives and battered the world’s economy. There were 47 coronavirus vaccines in WHO-approved clinical trials as of Nov. 3, a handful in most advanced testing.

Cuba has long exported vaccines to the developing world, including shots against meningitis and hepatitis B, although data on recent sales is not public.

Late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro backed a home-grown biotech sector in the 1980s, partly so Cuba could become more self-sufficient in the face of a U.S. trade embargo. It has since become a major part of the economy.

Cuba’s vaccine program has drawn interest from ally Venezuela, whose president, Nicolas Maduro, said in August that the ALBA bloc of eight leftist Latin American and Caribbean countries backed it.

Other Latin American nations are prioritizing deals with major drugmakers and considering vaccines also in advanced testing from China and Russia.

Mexico’s foreign ministry told Reuters in August it planned to approach Cuba about its vaccine. As of last month, the ministry said those talks had not advanced.

The Addis Ababa-based Africa CDC said Cuba has a good scientific reputation and signaled potential interest once data on its vaccines become available.

Cuba will favor exports to countries with which it has existing healthcare agreements, after ensuring it has enough for its own needs, a health official told the journal MEDICC Review.

“We are making a big effort to be able to start vaccinating all the Cuban population in the first half of next year,” said Vicente Vérez, director of the Finlay Institute, Cuba’s foremost vaccine research center, during a visit by President Miguel Diaz-Canel last month.

VACCINE KNOW HOW

Scientists are hailed as heroes in Cuba, a prestige that helps limit brain drain despite low salaries and difficult conditions, as Cuban researchers contend with U.S. sanctions that hamper international collaboration and the purchase of supplies.

State-run media have run lengthy profiles of researchers working at Finlay, one of 20 research centers and 32 companies employing some 20,000 people that make up the state-run BioCubaFarma corporation.

Cuba produces 8 of the 12 vaccines in its national immunization program and has exported hundreds of millions of vaccines to more than 40 countries, according to BioCubaFarma President Eduardo Martinez.

Finlay’s Sovereign 1 and Sovereign 2 vaccines are being tested in hundreds and scores of people, respectively. Officials have not said when they expect to start pivotal trials involving thousands of volunteers.

Both vaccines target a part of the spike protein of the novel coronavirus called the receptor binding domain, which helps the virus stick to cells.

Sovereign 1 has generated antibodies blocking infection in rats and rabbits, and has so far proven safe in midstage human trials.

Cuba said last week it expects to have two more experimental COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials by year end, including one administered through the nose to immunize mucous membranes - a key entry point for the virus.

A diversified portfolio would help Cuba match the best type of vaccine to the appropriate population groups, BioCubaFarma’s Martinez said.

POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL HURDLES

Cuba’s ambitions may be challenged when researchers are ready to launch late-stage trials. Vaccines are more easily tested in places with rampant virus spread, but Cuba’s transmission rate is very low, with just about 500 confirmed active cases.

Political tensions with neighbors like Brazil may make it harder for Cuban researchers to find trial sites abroad.

Foreign ministry officials in Argentina and Mexico, which are hosting late-stage trials for several vaccines, said they were not aware of talks with Cuba.

Cash-strapped Cuba may also struggle to buy raw materials for large-scale vaccine production.

It could rely on other countries to handle manufacturing, said Jose Luis Di Fabio, a former PAHO vaccine coordinator and Cuba representative.

“By using prior expertise,” said Maria Bottazzi, co-leader of a vaccine development team at Houston’s Baylor College of Medicine, “the Cubans have created two vaccines that sound technologically quite promising.”Cuba leads race for Latin American coronavirus vaccine - Reuters IndiaAs Latin American nations test experimental coronavirus vaccines from across the globe and economic heavyweights such as Brazil and Mexico jockey for supply deals with major drugmakers, Communist-run Cuba already has two of its own vaccines in clinical trials.HAVANA (Reuters) - As Latin American nations test experimental coronavirus vaccines from across the globe and economic heavyweights such as Brazil and Mexico jockey for supply deals with major drugmakers, Communist-run Cuba already has two of its own vaccines in clinical trials.

Should its efforts succeed, the Caribbean island could become an important supplier to neighboring countries that might otherwise struggle to access vaccine supply as wealthy Western nations rush to secure doses, regional experts said.

“Cuba’s contribution with its vaccine could be very important for certain vulnerable groups in our region” such as the elderly, or remote indigenous communities, Jose Moya, the representative in Cuba for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), told Reuters.

If a Cuban vaccine proves safe and effective, it would become available for purchase in the region through PAHO, the Americas regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO), Moya said.

Factbox: Development of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - Reuters UKDrugmaker Pfizer said on Wednesday that final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective, and that it would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days.(Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer PFE.N said on Wednesday that final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective, and that it would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days.

Pfizer said efficacy of the vaccine was consistent across age and ethnic groups, and that there were no major side effects, a sign that the immunization could be employed broadly around the world.

The final analysis of the vaccine from U.S. company Pfizer and German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F comes one week after initial results from the trial showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective.

Dozens of drugmakers and research groups have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which has killed more than 1.3 million people, shuttered businesses and left millions out of work around the globe.

Below are the main details of the vaccine and progress on supply deals and potential approvals:

TYPE

- The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity.

- mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.

- The new technology has not been approved for any vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA.

DOSAGE AND EXPECTED COST

- Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment.

- Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay.

PROTECTION DURATION

- BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last.

DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE

- U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a ‘fast track’ status in mid-July.

- The European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday that Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted data from large-scale trial of their potential COVID-19 vaccine for the agency’s rolling review, but had not yet applied for approval.

- Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April.

- Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month.

TRIALS

- Trials are continuing globally in 154 locations, including in Germany, Japan, Brazil and in several locations within the United States in participants aged 12 years and older. The global Phase I/II/III trials enrolled about 44,000 volunteers. (bit.ly/3lfaaeF)

TARGETED DOSES

- Currently the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine in 2020 - enough to protect 25 million people

- The companies expect to manufacture up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

Coronavirus vaccine hope threatens stay-at-home darlings - ReutersThe surge in shares of Netflix <NFLX.O>, Zoom <ZM.O> and other of this year's stay-at-home corporate winners has been brought to a sudden halt by promising vaccine data suggesting a possible way out of the COVID-19 pandemic.(Reuters) - The surge in shares of Netflix NFLX.O, Zoom ZM.O and other of this year's stay-at-home corporate winners has been brought to a sudden halt by promising vaccine data suggesting a possible way out of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The jury was still out on Tuesday, however, as to whether that reverse, sparked by positive data from trials run by U.S. drugs giant Pfizer PFE.N and Germany's BioNtech 22UAy.DE, would last.

Shares in video conferencing network Zoom fell 4% on Tuesday after plunging about 17% a day earlier. But both exercise bike maker Peloton, which sank more than 20% on Monday, and Netflix, actually gained ground on Tuesday.

Tech heavyweights from Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O to Apple AAPL.O and Amazon AMZN.O also suffered but have still mushroomed hugely in value this year.

“Even if a vaccine proves effective, inoculating a large enough part of the population will take time and leave these segments prone to economic lockdown fallout,” said Commerzbank analyst Christoph Rieger.

The shakiness of moves may have reflected both those doubts about the speed at which a vaccine can be produced and distributed as well as the remaining doubts about whether it will work as a solution in the long-run.

But there is also the conviction that the pandemic has fundamentally changed business for many of these companies in ways that will not be reversed.

“Investors are now focused on how the ‘new normal’ looks ... and how sustainable are the tailwinds for such companies as the direct impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior starts to diminish,” MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni, said.

Peloton, which has seen demand for its at-home fitness systems soar due to gym closures, recently posted a 274% jump in quarterly profit for its unit which sells interactive fitness equipment.

An outstanding beneficiary among tech stocks from the shift to work from home is Zoom, whose shares have jumped over 460% this year as corporate firms, schools, and organizations run countless virtual meetings on its video conferencing app.

Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O have seen a substantial boost to their business but the capital they have available for new investment has soared as a result - potentially giving them more leverage going forward.

Shares of video game and e-sports related companies, which benefited from long cancellations of traditional sports leagues, tumbled after Pfizer's announcement, with game studios such as Activision Blizzard ATVI.O and Take-Two Interactive Software TTWO.O ending Monday's session lower.

Gaming peripheral makers such as Turtle Beach HEAR.O and Corsair Gaming CRSR.O also tumbled on Monday, while U.S. listed shares of game developers and e-sports organizers Bilibili Inc BILI.O and Sea Limited SE.N saw their worst day since March.

All, however, are still up between 50% and 350% since March, while Corsair has risen 57% since its initial public offering in September.

“The market is likely discounting a deceleration of growth for the sector in 2021,” said Will Hershey, CEO of Roundhill Investments.

“However, I believe that the growth in gaming due to the pandemic likely increased the trajectory of gaming adoption for years to come.”Coronavirus vaccine hope threatens stay-at-home darlings - ReutersThe surge in shares of Netflix <NFLX.O>, Zoom <ZM.O> and other of this year's stay-at-home corporate winners has been brought to a sudden halt by promising vaccine data suggesting a possible way out of the COVID-19 pandemic.(Reuters) - The surge in shares of Netflix NFLX.O, Zoom ZM.O and other of this year's stay-at-home corporate winners has been brought to a sudden halt by promising vaccine data suggesting a possible way out of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This does not mean anyone can just go online and order one of the kits whenever they please. Emergency use authorizations fast-track drugs and other medical supplies through the normally lengthy vetting process designed to ensure they are safe and effective, but they typically come with restrictions on in what circumstances they can be used. In this case, the FDA’s order allows for the kit to be made available to those ages 14 or older only with a valid prescription, and those younger can only receive the test if it is performed by healthcare workers. The order also allows for medical personnel to administer the test in a variety of healthcare settings ranging from doctors’ offices to emergency rooms.

At-home tests could help limit potential virus exposures in medical settings, increase testing rates, and relieve laboratories and test sites facing crushing demand. Mail-order kits already exist but have to be shipped back to a lab.

According to NPR, the kits are only expected to be available in limited quantities in Florida and California for now.

The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit is a molecular diagnostic test kit that can be used once and detects RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab specimens. The swabs are inserted into a small electronic device that displays whether the result is positive or negative.

“While COVID-19 diagnostic tests have been authorized for at-home collection, this is the first that can be fully self-administered and provide results at home,” Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the FDA, told CNN in a statement. “...This new testing option is an important diagnostic advancement to address the pandemic and reduce the public burden of disease transmission.”

Lucira told NBC News its test is 94.1% sensitive and has a specificity rate of 98% . Sensitivity is a measurement of how often the test correctly generates a positive result, while specificity measures how likely a test is giving a correct negative result (the higher the rate, the less chance of a false positive) . For example, an airport metal detector is highly sensitive, but very non-specific, as it detects most metallic objects but provides no further information to the operator on whether it is a false alarm (loose change) or a real problem (a pistol).

According to the New York Times, Lucira’s test is less accurate than laboratory-performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which use reagents designed to make specific types of genetic material (such as viral RNA) duplicate themselves to detectable levels. The Lucira kit relies on loop mediated amplification reaction, a similar method that cuts some corners to generate speedier results. The Times also noted that Lucira’s study was small, self-conducted, and only involved participants exhibiting symptoms of the virus, meaning it hasn’t been vetted for use on asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals who only suspect they may have the virus.

Tom Bollyky, the Council on Foreign Relations’ director of global health and senior fellow for global health, economics, and development, told CNN that although some wariness is warranted, expanding the test kit roster available to healthcare workers and public health authorities is good news.

“The data is just still emerging,” Bollyky said. “Obviously with some past emergency use authorizations it pays to be cautious with what the FDA has put out here, but it’s certainly a promising sign.”

The U.S. has lagged to an embarrassing degree on testing since the start of the pandemic. The coronavirus is now considered to be spreading uncontrollably in the vast majority of the country, with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine tracker estimating over 11.4 million confirmed cases and nearly 250,000 deaths. There are now very few places in the country where numbers of new cases are not increasing. As NPR noted, that means the U.S. is again struggling to meet demand for testing services, resulting in long lines and delayed test results.

There is good news, however. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced full results from a Phase III trial of its experimental covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, with findings that suggested it could be 95 percent effective at preventing illness. Competitor Moderna released nearly identical results on Monday. Both companies are expected to seek emergency use authorizations from the FDA within days.

Though Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said the feds expect 40 million doses of the vaccine (enough for 20 million people, who will require two doses each) to be available in the U.S. by the end of the year, experts say it will take until mid-2021 at the absolute earliest to achieve herd immunity in the states. That’s when enough people are immune to the virus that it struggles to spread to new hosts, choking off its growth. However, ensuring widespread availability across the U.S.—let alone the entire globe—is a daunting task, with potential difficulties including everything from socioeconomic inequality to propaganda from relatively small but extremely committed groups of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists.FDA Issues First Emergency Use Authorization for Rapid, At-Home Covid-19 TestThe Food and Drug Administration has approved the first rapid coronavirus test kit that can be performed at home, issuing an emergency use authorization to manufacturer Lucira Health late on Tuesday.Read more...A medical worker holding a swab at ProHEALTH center in Brooklyn in August 2020.

Two COVID-19 vaccines are working. So what comes next?Is the COVID-19 vaccine waiting game almost over?
On Wednesday, pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had completed a clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine, and that data showed it was 95% effective at protecting against the virus. T…Is the COVID-19 vaccine waiting game almost over?

On Wednesday, pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had completed a clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine, and that data showed it was 95% effective at protecting against the virus. The companies had said last week that the vaccine appeared over 90% effective in an early analysis. Moderna also announced on Monday that one of its vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was over 94% effective, according to a preliminary analysis. Pfizer, a United States company, and BioNTech, a German company, are the first to complete phase 3 clinical testing for a COVID-19 vaccine, which is the final stage before a drug can be approved in the U.S.

“Everybody is excited about the light at the end of the tunnel of this pandemic,” said Dr. Graham Snyder, the medical director for infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “Vaccines represent a part of that.”

But while Snyder said these results are indeed exciting, there are still a lot of questions left to be answered about the vaccines. Moderna's results are only preliminary, and although Pfizer's trial is complete, both results were published in press releases, not journals reviewed by other scientists. Until results are published in scientific journals, the most detailed data from both trials is unavailable. It’s also unclear if these vaccines prevent only the symptoms of COVID-19 or the infection itself, and whether or not the disease can still be transmitted by those who get the vaccine. With Pfizer submitting its vaccine for emergency approval in the next few days, the answers to these questions will determine not only if these vaccines are approved, but what to expect once a COVID-19 vaccine is available.

The approval process for any drug has a strict set of steps, and COVID-19 vaccines are no exception, although the process has gone much more quickly than usual. An early analysis like the one Moderna has released and Pfizer released last week, which is done while a clinical trial is still ongoing, is called an interim analysis and is a typical part of the clinical trial process. It's conducted by a group separate from the drug’s developers in order to get an unbiased look at whether the drug seems to be working, is unsafe, or is extremely ineffective. Often, the results of these analyses aren’t even released to the public.

“We’re all on the edge of our seats for news,” said Snyder. He said vaccine manufacturers like Moderna and Pfizer are more inclined to release this type of results because people are anxious to know if vaccines like theirs will work.

Interim analyses like Moderna's are by no means the same as final trial results, said Snyder. Moderna reported that 95 people in the trial had gotten COVID-19; the trial needs a total of 151 participants to get the disease before it can analyze the final results. Pfizer's interim analysis reported 94 cases, but it's since surpassed the required number of cases for the trial with 170 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Clinical trials like this one are separated into a treatment group, which receives the vaccine, and a group which receives an identical-looking but innocuous shot called a placebo. Both trials got their effectiveness percentages by comparing which group people who got sick were in — in both cases, about 95% were in the placebo group. But Moderna's percentage could very well change as the trial continues.

There are other reasons to be optimistic about the vaccines. So far, a total of 11 people in Moderna’s trial have had severe cases of COVID-19, and all of them took the placebo. In Pfizer’s completed trial, 10 people got severe cases of the disease, and only one had received the vaccine. Both trials also had relatively mild side effects. Of the side effects rated as most severe, fatigue was the most common in both trials. Pfizer reported that a headache was the only other more severe side effect; Moderna also listed muscle pain, joint pain, and redness at the injection site.

It will be harder to convince people to take a vaccine that will hurt, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told NBC news, especially since the vaccines require patients to go back for second dose. But Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said its vaccine's side effects are on par with many other adult vaccinations, although more severe than those common with the flu vaccine. Most of the side effects for Moderna's vaccine seemed to come after the second dose.

Both Snyder and Geoffrey Holm, a virologist at Colgate University, pointed to another significant distinction: While both vaccines must be refrigerated, Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be stored in extreme cold: minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 70 C). Moderna’s can be stored at slightly higher temperatures (-20 C) and will last for about a month. It can also be stored at room temperature for 12 hours. In contrast, Pfizer’s vaccine, which must be frozen, thawed to 35.6 to 46.4 F (2 to 8 C) and used within five days, has already raised logistical concerns about its practicality in areas with less infrastructure.

Nevertheless, positive results have pleasantly surprised many, and not just because of the quick timeline. The two vaccines use a totally different mechanism from existing vaccines, said Holm. Instead of injecting a dead or deactivated version of the virus to provoke the immune system, the vaccines injects RNA, a type of genetic material, which essentially gives the body the instructions it needs for an immune response. Many researchers expected the fragile RNA to break apart and for the vaccine to not work, said Holm, and have been pleasantly surprised that this isn't the case. Now, researchers know the method could be effective in future vaccines, too.

Holm said there was no particular reason to believe that either vaccine would stop working on account of the new mechanism. Until there's more data on Moderna's vaccine, though, there’s no way to know for sure if the vaccine might stop working for any reason. Data gathered from both trials even after they are technically complete will tell us more about how safe and effective the vaccines are. Both trials will continue to collect data; Pfizer has said that it will continue collecting safety and efficacy data for the next two years.

It’s also possible that the vaccine will continue to “work” fine but will prevent all or most of the disease’s symptoms, not the actual infection, said Holm. In other words, people might still be able to transmit the virus to others even after they’ve received the vaccine. Snyder said that while most vaccines protect you from being contagious, some, like the flu vaccine, do not, even if you never feel sick. If a COVID-19 vaccine only prevents disease and not transmission, things like social distancing will likely be a good idea for much longer.

“If it prevents infection and therefore potentially prevents transmission that then gives you different parameters in terms of thinking about what's going to happen with the overall pandemic,” said Holm.

But of course, these vaccines haven’t been approved yet. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will submit the data from their completed vaccine trial to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the next few days, including an average of two months of safety data, which the FDA requires for EUA. Although EUA is not as extensive a process as full FDA approval, it still requires drug developers to submit extensive paperwork on everything from safety and efficacy on all three stages of clinical trials to information on the drug’s chemistry and how it will be manufactured.

The FDA will then evaluate if the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks. Although the time it takes for the FDA to issue emergency approval varies, the FDA said in a guidance document that during an emergency, "an EUA will be acted upon within a matter of hours or days."

Both developers are already planning for the potential global manufacturing and use of their vaccines. In addition to applying for EUA and eventually for final FDA approval, both Pfizer and Moderna have said they plan to submit the vaccine for approval in other countries and produce the vaccine globally.

Moderna says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of this year, and will have manufactured 500 million to 1 billion doses by the end of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to produce 50 million doses of their vaccine in 2020 and as many as 1.3 billion next year. The U.S. government will help fund and enact the companies' vaccine production and distribution through Operation Warp Speed, a federal program aiming to speed up the process of developing and distributing a coronavirus vaccine. Moderna has also received over $1 billion through the program to help develop its vaccine, while Pfizer didn't receive any money for development.

Even after a vaccine is approved and available, many questions remain unanswered, namely who can receive one. Pfizer's Dr. Gruber told Scientific American that the company plans to make its first doses available to healthcare workers on the front lines of fighting COVID-19 as soon as it gets emergency approval. Groups who are at particular risk of developing the virus, like older adults and people with some medical conditions, would also likely be among the first to receive a vaccine, according to the CDC. For everyone else, timing is unclear. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top expert on infectious disease, told Good Morning America that most people may be able to get a vaccine in April, May or June of 2021.

There’s one surprising drawback to any COVID-19 vaccine being approved. After a vaccine is available, developers are obligated to inform those who were in the placebo group that they did not receive the vaccine. If they then receive the vaccine, they would no longer be part of the trial, said Holm. It’s a troubling paradox, he said, if a necessary one. Because of this decrease in trial placebo group participants, it might be harder to gauge how effective the vaccine might be long-term, for instance if it doesn't protect against the virus after one or two years.

It'll also be a long time before things return to “normal,” even with a vaccine, said Holm. In a widely circulated video clip, Sir John Bell, a professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that things could go back to normal by the spring. Holm said he thinks that seems unlikely. Snyder said that it’s simply too soon to say, but emphasized how important it will be in the coming months to continue to take safety precautions like wearing a mask and maintaining social distance.

Of course, Moderna and Pfizer aren’t the only companies developing a COVID-19 vaccine. There are at least 65 COVID-19 vaccines seeking FDA approval in phase 3 development alone, and nearly 300 in total. Snyder emphasized that the sheer number, as well as the speed at which COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, is “mind-blowingly unprecedented.”

“If that doesn’t give you a sense of optimism,” he said, “I don’t know what does.”

WATCH: How these filmmakers made a pandemic documentary during a pandemic



Vaccine progress injects optimism into global stocks - ReutersGlobal stocks and oil jumped and Treasuries sold off on Monday as progress in the development of a coronavirus vaccine lifted investor confidence in a world economic recovery.NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 posted a modest loss and the Nasdaq closed sharply lower on Tuesday as promising news regarding an effective COVID-19 vaccine led investors away from market leaders and toward cyclical stocks associated with economic recovery.

The blue-chip Dow, buoyed by industrial shares, gained ground and crude oil prices extended the previous session’s surge as investors bet on a demand rebound.

Pfizer Inc PFE.N announced on Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with German partner BioNTech 22UAy.DE, showed in trials it had a 90% success rate in preventing infection.

The development led to investors taking profits from market-leading tech stocks that have thrived amid the pandemic recession, a sell-off which pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq deep into red territory.

“Equity markets in the U.S. have experienced the start of a significant rotation following the vaccine announcement,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “It’s been a dramatic change and it’s all in anticipation of returning to some form of economic normalcy once the vaccine has been distributed to the broad population.”

“The caveat is there’s a second wave to the virus that’s infecting a record number of people,” Ghriskey added. “But at least for now the markets are willing to look through that economic pain to better days ahead once the virus has been eradicated.”

Uncertainties from Washington still simmer in the background as President Donald Trump continued to press for investigations of election fraud following his defeat by Democrat challenger Joe Biden.

“The circus going on in DC which is causing concern about a smooth transition of administrations in the months ahead,” Ghriskey said. “The flames coming out of Washington are unrelenting and constant.”

The blue-chip Dow, buoyed by industrial shares, gained ground and crude oil prices extended the previous session’s surge as investors bet on a demand rebound.

Pfizer Inc PFE.N announced on Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with German partner BioNTech 22UAy.DE, showed in trials it had a 90% success rate in preventing infection.

The development led to investors taking profits from market-leading tech stocks that have thrived amid the pandemic recession, a sell-off which pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq deep into red territory.

“Equity markets in the U.S. have experienced the start of a significant rotation following the vaccine announcement,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “It’s been a dramatic change and it’s all in anticipation of returning to some form of economic normalcy once the vaccine has been distributed to the broad population.”

“The caveat is there’s a second wave to the virus that’s infecting a record number of people,” Ghriskey added. “But at least for now the markets are willing to look through that economic pain to better days ahead once the virus has been eradicated.”

Uncertainties from Washington still simmer in the background as President Donald Trump continued to press for investigations of election fraud following his defeat by Democrat challenger Joe Biden.

“The circus going on in DC which is causing concern about a smooth transition of administrations in the months ahead,” Ghriskey said. “The flames coming out of Washington are unrelenting and constant.”

Wall Street ends sharply lower as pandemic fears resurge - Reuters CanadaWall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday as U.S. coronavirus infections surged and investors weighed the timeline for the mass rollout of an effective vaccine.(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday as U.S. coronavirus infections surged and investors weighed the timeline for the mass rollout of an effective vaccine.

New York became the latest state to introduce stricter social distancing rules on Wednesday, as new infections in the country surged above 100,000 for an eighth consecutive day.

The blue-chip Dow .DJI was pulled down by industrial and financial companies sensitive to economic growth, with Boeing Co BA.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N down 3% and 1.6%, respectively.

Airlines and cruise operators, among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, also fell. The S&P 1500 airlines index .SPCOMAIR dropped 3.1%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N fell 4% and Carnival Corp CCL.N tumbled almost 8%.

“The market is reacting to the rise in COVID cases nationwide,” said Michael Antonelli, a market strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “Vaccine news helps at some point in the future, but today we are dealing with an accelerating spread,”

Even after Thursday’s drop, the S&P 500 has gained almost 2% this week, buoyed by positive vaccine trial data that increased expectations of a quick economic recovery. Stocks have also benefited from expectations that a divided Congress will keep President-elect Joe Biden from enacting tax hikes that would hurt corporate profits.

“The reality is that we don’t know what the new normal is going to look like, even when we do recover from the coronavirus, and that is still a ways away,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

MANILA (Reuters) - Clover Biopharmaceuticals is seeking to conduct late-stage clinical trials in the Philippines of its coronavirus vaccine, the country’s foods and drugs agency chief said on Friday.

Clover is the second Chinese developer to apply for Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines following Sinovac Biotech, which is seeking to begin trials of its vaccine as early as next month.

Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) head Rolando Enrique Domingo told reporters Clover’s COVID-19 vaccine would first be evaluated by an expert panel before it could proceed to the next stage of the approval process.

The Philippines is also evaluating COVID-19 vaccines of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute for late-stage trials.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he preferred that his country source its COVID-19 vaccines from either China or Russia.

He also said he wanted the entire population vaccinated, with priority given to the poor and the country’s security forces.

Bangladesh signs deal with India for 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine - Reuters IndiaBangladesh signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India on Thursday to buy 30 million doses of potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India on Thursday to buy 30 million doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

AstraZeneca’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine is seen as one of the most advanced candidates in the race against the novel coronavirus.

“Whenever the vaccine is ready, the Serum Institute will give us 30 million doses in the first phase,” health minister Zahid Maleque told reporters after the deal was signed in Dhaka.

He said 5 million doses of vaccine per month would be purchased through Bangladesh’s drug maker, Beximco Pharmaceuticals.

“We’ll be able to vaccinate 15 million people as two shots of vaccine are required for each person 28 days apart,” Maleque said.

He said Serum Institute would provide the vaccine at a price similar to that which India pays. Sources said the cost could be $4 to $5 per dose.

Bangladesh was in talks with development partners, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to secure funds for the vaccine, government officials said.

Meanwhile, there are doubts over Sinovac Biotech’s late-stage trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine in Bangladesh after Dhaka refused to meet the Chinese company’s demand for co-funding.

Experts fear Bangladesh might face another surge in infections during the winter, having so far confirmed 416,006 cases, including 6,021 deaths.

The Serum Institute, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, has partnered with AstraZeneca, the Gates Foundation and the Gavi vaccine alliance to produce more than a billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine for global supply.

It is holding trials for three potential coronavirus vaccines, including one licensed to AstraZeneca by Oxford University.

AstraZeneca said on Thursday that it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from late-stage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelf-life of supplies.

The drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world, while data in October showed the vaccine produces an immune response in both old and young adults.Bangladesh signs deal with India for 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine - Reuters IndiaBangladesh signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India on Thursday to buy 30 million doses of potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India on Thursday to buy 30 million doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can be 90% effective, results show - Reuters IndiaAstraZeneca said on Monday its vaccine for the novel coronavirus, developed along with the University of Oxford, could be around 90% effective under one dosing regimen.LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine was 70% effective in pivotal trials and could be up to 90% effective, giving the world’s fight against the global pandemic a third new weapon that can be cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than rivals.

The British drugmaker said it will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, around four times as many as U.S. competitor Pfizer Inc. Seven hundred million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.

“This means we have a vaccine for the world,” said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford University vaccine group that developed the drug.

The vaccine on average prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil. The success rate rose to 90% in a group of trial participants who accidentally received a half dose followed by a full dose. The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.

No serious safety events were confirmed, the company said, although little safety data was provided.

AstraZeneca’s shares fell nearly 4%, as investors perceived the efficacy data as less impressive than rival vaccines and may take longer to get U.S regulatory approval. Pfizer and Moderna, which reported that their vaccines were about 95% effective in preventing illness, had set the success bar sky-high.

The AstraZeneca vaccine does have advantages.

Its cost to governments works out at just a few dollars a shot, a fraction of the price of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines using a new, more complex technology.

It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute - especially in poor countries - than Pfizer’s, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.

The 90% efficacy finding was a happy accident, AstraZeneca admitted, noting that it resulted from a dosing error during the trials. The half dose-first regimen will enable the company to seek approval based on far higher effectiveness than 62%, which was still enough for a regulatory nod based on prior discussions.

AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the smaller initial dose means limited supplies could stretch even further to vaccinate more people.

‘NOT A PANDEMIC WITHOUT END’

The faster roll-out means countries that had been drawing up plans to ration vaccines can distribute them more widely, helping to eventually halt the social and economic disruption of a pandemic that has killed 1.4 million people.

“Vaccines are now edging ever closer to liberating us from the virus, demonstrating emphatically that this is not a pandemic without end,” Britain Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Monday.

Matt Hancock, health secretary of Britain which has pre-ordered 100 million doses for its 67 million people, said the bulk of the vaccine rollout will take place January-March.

“We hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal,” he said.

In poor countries, where the logistics of distributing rival vaccines posed a bigger challenge, the effect of a cheaper and easier alternative could be even more pronounced.

“The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius (35.6°-46.4°F) and we have that storage facility,” said Zahid Maleque, health minister of Bangladesh, which is buying in 30 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

The Philippines is close to concluding talks with AstraZeneca on the purchase of at least 20 million vaccine doses, a top coronavirus task force official said on Monday.

The World Health Organization’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the WHO is anxious to see full efficacy and safety data and encouraged other vaccine developers, saying vast quantities and a variety of shots will be needed.

“We have to cover ... billions and billions of people. We will need all the manufacturing capacity in the world in order to do that,” Swaminathan said.

‘WE’LL BE A LOT HAPPIER’

There was criticism of AstraZeneca’s data release.

Healthcare analysts from SVB Leerink said AstraZeneca had not disclosed enough information about safety events that led to a pause in the Phase III trials, and cited other study limitations.

Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose.

Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges suggested the vaccine was unlikely to receive U.S. approval, noting the trials did not appear to meet U.S. requirements for representation of minorities, the elderly and other high-risk populations.

AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.

Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.

“I think it is a real fool’s errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of Phase III data from press releases,” said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.

“My suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we’ll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we’ll be a lot happier.”

The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).

AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to regulators around the world and seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries.AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine can be 90% effective, results show - Reuters IndiaAstraZeneca said on Monday its vaccine for the novel coronavirus, developed along with the University of Oxford, could be around 90% effective under one dosing regimen.LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine was 70% effective in pivotal trials and could be up to 90% effective, giving the world’s fight against the global pandemic a third new weapon that can be cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than rivals.

The World Health Organization’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the WHO is anxious to see full efficacy and safety data and encouraged other vaccine developers, saying vast quantities and a variety of shots will be needed.

“We have to cover ... billions and billions of people. We will need all the manufacturing capacity in the world in order to do that,” Swaminathan said.

‘WE’LL BE A LOT HAPPIER’

There was criticism of AstraZeneca’s data release.

Healthcare analysts from SVB Leerink said AstraZeneca had not disclosed enough information about safety events that led to a pause in the Phase III trials, and cited other study limitations.

Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose.

Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges suggested the vaccine was unlikely to receive U.S. approval, noting the trials did not appear to meet U.S. requirements for representation of minorities, the elderly and other high-risk populations.

AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.

Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.

“I think it is a real fool’s errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of Phase III data from press releases,” said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.

“My suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we’ll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we’ll be a lot happier.”

The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).

AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to regulators around the world and seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries.



Kenya joins global trial of Oxford University's COVID-19 vaccine - Reuters UKKenya has joined the global clinical trial of Oxford University's vaccine candidate against the new coronavirus, the state medical research institute said on Friday.NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya has joined the global clinical trial of Oxford University’s vaccine candidate against the new coronavirus, the state medical research institute said on Friday.

The vaccine candidate, known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, has been developed jointly with Astrazeneca and is being evaluated in four countries: Britain, South Africa, Brazil and now Kenya.

“To ensure that Kenyans can benefit... if it proves to be successful, it is important to assess its performance among Kenyan volunteers,” the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) said in a statement.

KEMRI has already vaccinated the first volunteers after receiving the receiving the required regulatory and ethical approvals, it said.

The experiment in Kenya will initially involve 40 frontline workers in the coastal county of Kilifi.

If that phase ascertains the vaccine’s safety, then an additional 360 volunteers will also be recruited into the programme.

The East African nation has seen a surge in the weekly number of infections in the past month, after the government lifted some restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.

It has so far recorded 52,612 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 964 deaths.

The novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.17 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.

US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall St rises at open as Moderna says vaccine 94.5% effective - Reuters IndiaUS STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall St rises at open as Moderna says vaccine 94.5% effective  Reuters IndiaNEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average notched record closing highs on Monday as news of another promising coronavirus vaccine fanned hopes of eradicating COVID-19, while spiking infections and new shutdowns threatened to hobble a recovery from the pandemic recession.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced and with its new closing record, the blue-chip Dow is the last of the three to reclaim levels reached in February, before lockdowns sent the markets into free-fall.

The Russell 2000 also hit an all-time closing high.

Value, cyclical and small cap shares outperformed the broader market.

Moderna Inc said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection based on interim late-state data. It was the second drugmaker in as my weeks, after Pfizer Inc, to announce promising trial data in the development of a vaccine to defeat the pandemic. Its shares gained 9.6% on the day.

Combined, pending further data and regulatory review, the United States could have as many as 60 million emergency doses available this year.

“More vaccine news is driving cyclicals, small caps and value, which would be primed if the economy reopens sooner than expected, returning us to some sense of normalcy,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.

Travel-related stocks, which have been clobbered by restrictions to contain the pandemic’s spread, were in demand.

Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc, American Airlines Group Inc, Carnival Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd jumped between 4.5% and 9.7%.

But COVID-19 continued its U.S. rampage, with cases surging past 11 million and record infections in 40 states, prompting states to tighten social distancing mandates.

“Wall Street is looking out six to 12 months down the road,” Pavlik added. “There is a question about ... what kind of damage will be inflicted on the economy between now and then.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 470.63 points, or 1.6%, to 29,950.44; the S&P 500 gained 41.76 points, or 1.16%, at 3,626.91; and the Nasdaq Composite added 94.84 points, or 0.8%, at 11,924.13.

Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but healthcare ended the session in the black, with energy stocks enjoying the largest percentage gain.

Earnings from high-profile retailers are expected this week, with Walmart Inc and Home Depot Inc expected to report on Tuesday and Lowe’s Companies Inc and Target Corp on Wednesday.

This, together with the Commerce Department’s October retail sales data, expected on Tuesday, should provide evidence of how consumers are weathering a languid economic recovery as stimulus runs dry.

Simon Property Group Inc jumped 5.7% after the biggest U.S. mall operator cut its purchase price for an 80% stake of rival Taubman Centers Inc, as the pandemic pressures the retailers.

EU says more vaccine deals to come soon as Moderna unveils positive results - Reuters IndiaThe European Commission said on Monday that positive results announced by U.S. biotech firm Moderna <MRNA.O> for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were encouraging and said the bloc was working to sign more supply deals with vaccine makers.BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission wants to reach a deal with Moderna Inc MRNA.O for the supply of millions of doses of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate for a price below $25 per dose, an EU official involved in the talks said.

Moderna said on Monday its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second developer to report results that far exceeded expectations, after Pfizer PFE.N and BioNTech BNTX.O said last week their vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective.

The EU has been in talks with Moderna for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine at least since July, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows. Reuters first reported the negotiations in July.

A deal might be reached in the coming days, the senior official involved in the talks said, adding that discussions were mostly focusing on the legal wording of the contract, but faced no major hurdles on issues such as price or liability.

The price being negotiated was below $25 per dose, said the official, who declined to be more specific and asked for anonymity as the talks were confidential.

Moderna was not immediately available to comment.

The United States paid Moderna $15 per dose to secure 100 million vaccines in a $1.5 billion deal in August. That was on top of $1 billion in funding for Moderna’s vaccine, effectively bringing the combined price to $25, according to the publicly released terms of the deal.

Washington has an option to buy another 400 million doses for an undisclosed price.

Moderna’s vaccine is administered with a two-shot course.

NEW DEALS ‘COMING SOON’

EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on Twitter that Moderna’s results were “encouraging” and that new EU deals with vaccine makers were to “come soon”.

“Negotiations with the company are ongoing. We have not yet concluded or signed a contract,” Kyriakides told EU lawmakers in a regular hearing on Monday.

A spokesman for the Commission did not respond to questions on price and the timing of a possible deal with Moderna.

On Aug. 24 the Commission, which conducts talks with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, said preliminary talks with Moderna had been concluded with the aim of signing a contract for the supply of 80 million doses of its vaccine, with the option of buying another 80 million.

Last week, the Commission reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech on the supply of their potential COVID-19 vaccine hours after the companies announced their positive results, EU officials said, adding that the timing was a coincidence.

The formal signing of that contract is expected later this week.

An official told Reuters the EU had agreed to pay less than $19.50 per shot to Pfizer and BioNTech, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug’s development.

The EU has also struck supply deals with AstraZeneca AZN.L, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Sanofi SASY.PA for their experimental COVID-19 vaccines.

</li>…The Monday morning announcement from Cambridge-based Moderna that the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing appears to be 94.5% effective is “very good news,” according to Dr. Ashish Jha.

Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, appeared on CBS This Morning to provide insight into what the news, which follows a week after Pfizer gave a similar update on their vaccine’s progress, means as the pandemic continues to rage.

“We are entering the hardest time of the pandemic,” Jha told the network Monday. “I think the next two or three months are going to be awful across the country. But [what] the Pfizer vaccine [and the] Moderna vaccine do is give us hope that in a few months, this will really start turning around. The light at the end of the tunnel just got a little bit brighter.”

The doctor stressed that there are still logistical and “complicated” issues that need to be addressed as the work continues toward a rollout of a vaccine.

“We’ve got to get tens of millions of vaccines out to states, to pharmacies, doctors offices,” he said. “That needs a lot of planning. There has not been a lot of that planning out of the federal government right now. There’s been some, but we need a lot more of that.”

Jha cautioned that even with the promising news on the vaccines being developed, it will be some time before things return to “normal.”

“Even if we had 10 or 20 million people getting vaccinated over the next few months, until we get to 50, 60 percent of the American population vaccinated — and that’s at best case scenario April/May — I think we’re still some ways away from something that will be the new normal,” he said.

And before it gets better, the country is facing a situation where the virus is going to get “meaningfully worse” in the coming weeks based on the current trends of new cases and hospitalizations, he said.

“The bottom line is that hospitals are at capacity and they are still about to get a flood of new patients, so it’s going to be an even bigger wave of patients,” Jha said. “So I’m very worried about the next month. We know what we need to do. Everybody needs to wear a mask, we need to avoid any kind of indoor gathering. And then states have to do more on testing.”

Jha said every state needs to be following the lead of Michigan, which is instituting limits on indoor activities and other events for three weeks to stem the spread of COVID-19. The order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer includes moving high school and college classes online, closing indoor service at bars and restaurants, shuttering movie theaters and casinos, and pausing youth sports.

What Michigan is doing is “absolutely essential,” Jha said.

“It’s amazing to me that other states are not following,” he said. “I suspect that this week we are going to see a lot of other states step up and essentially put in very similar policies because we’re so behind the 8-ball. We’ve got to get going.”Watch: What Dr. Ashish Jha had to say about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine news - Boston.com<ol><li>Watch: What Dr. Ashish Jha had to say about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine news  Boston.com

VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – A third drug company is claiming its COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective against the virus and that it’s ready to seek approvals just a week after two other candidates also touted promising results.

“These findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives. Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply,” Professor Andrew Pollard, the chief investigators of the Oxford Vaccine trial, says.

AstraZeneca says its vaccine, developed at Oxford University, is showing at least a 62 per cent efficacy. However, with a small tweak in dosages, it seems to be about 90 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19.

The team found the most effective dosing regimen was to give a half-dose of the vaccine at first, followed by a full dose, one month later. The less effective dosing regimen saw volunteers given two full doses one month apart.

The AstraZeneca-Oxford team is now working to submit its data to agencies around the world for conditional or early approval of its vaccine candidate.

“Positive high-level results from an interim analysis of clinical trials of AZD1222 in the UK and Brazil showed the vaccine was highly effective in preventing COVID-19, the primary endpoint, and no hospitalisations or severe cases of the disease were reported in participants receiving the vaccine,” the company says. “There were a total of 131 COVID-19 cases in the interim analysis.”

Just 30 people given two doses contracted the virus while 101 people given a placebo got ill.

“Furthermore, the vaccine’s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval,” AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot adds.

Pfizer and Moderna last week reported preliminary results from late-stage trials show their vaccines provide close to 95 per cent protection against the virus. But AstraZeneca’s vaccine would be cheaper and easier to store, as it doesn’t need to be held in extreme sub-zero temperatures like its competitors’ candidates.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet on Dec. 10 to decide whether to approve Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, produced in partnership with German BioNTech, for emergency use.

If it is approved, “operation warp speed” could be underway to vaccinate America by Dec. 12.

Both Pfizer and Moderna have also begun “rolling” applications for approval with other agencies around the world, including Canada.COVID-19 vaccines edge closer to reality as third company releases trial results - News 1130<ol><li>COVID-19 vaccines edge closer to reality as third company releases trial results  News 1130

According to Joaquín Duato, vice president of the Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson, its coronavirus vaccine will be released in the second half of 2021.

The drugmaker plans to distribute 1 billion doses at a cost of less than $ 10.

The race to obtain the long-awaited vaccine against COVID-19 is increasingly close. Pharmaceutical Janssen, part of the Johnson & Johnson group, promises that its vaccine will be available by the second half of 2021. And the best thing is the price, since it would cost less than 10 dollars, that is, about 200 Mexican pesos.

Joaquín Duato, vice president of the Executive Committee of the American multinational, gave the good news during a conference at the Health Sector Sector Meeting, organized by IESE Business School , with the collaboration of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

The study by the pharmaceutical company Janssen, approved yesterday by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products, guarantees the vaccine "at some point in the first or second half of 2021".

The Johnson & Johnson executive said that the pharmaceutical company has a plan to supply 1,000 million during 2021. This will be achieved through collaboration networks with governments and organizations, such as COVAX, a project to which 500 million doses will be allocated. of its production for the lower-income countries.

"During the next six months there will be good news, we can see how these effective vaccines will be available to the public," Duato said at the same event. He added that the vaccine they are working on will also guarantee "the quality and safety standards" announced by other companies in the sector.

The multinational assures that the cost of the vaccine will not respond to profit, but to the general welfare. "We will seek to guarantee access to the vaccine in all territories, the price will not be more than 10 dollars per vaccine," said the manager.

This week, the American pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna published the clinical results of phase 3 of their respective vaccines. Both were close to 95% effective, which is excellent news for the rest of the laboratories focused on the same protein.

Regarding the race to find the coronavirus vaccine, the senior executive commented that “it is not a competitive situation, it is a social issue and a global crisis in which we will need several vaccines, not just one, because we must vaccinate millions of people ”.Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be available in 2021 for 200 Mexican pesos!The drugmaker plans to distribute 1 billion doses over the next year.November 20, 2020 3 min read

Independent UN experts decry COVID vaccine hoarding: ‘No one is secure until all of us are’ - DevdiscourseThe only way to fight the COVID-19 crisis is to make affordable vaccines available to everyone, independent UN human rights experts said on Monday, underscoring that in an interconnected and interdependent world, “no one is secure until all of us are secure”."This pandemic, with its global scale and enormous human cost, with no clear end in sight, requires a concerted, human-rights based and courageous response from all States", four UN experts together with members of a human rights working group said in a statement on universal access to vaccines.

Spiking ahead

Last month, the World Bank estimated that the pandemic would push between 88 and 115 million people into extreme poverty this year, potentially climbing to a total of 150 million during 2021.

And the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has doubled its pre-COVID-19 estimates of hungry people, to project that 265 million would face crisis levels unless direct action is taken.

'No room' for nationalism

Engaging in a coordinated global effort to share vaccines across borders is the only means of effectively beating the coronavirus.

The UN experts stressed, "there is no room for nationalism in fighting this pandemic".

"Unfortunately, some Governments are trying to secure vaccines only for their own citizens", they detailed, adding, however, that this would "not achieve their intended purpose" as a successful fight against the pandemic depends on mass immunization.

Equitable access call

The independent experts called on countries to support the COVAX initiative for global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

"Under international human rights law, access to any COVID-19 vaccine and treatment must be made available to all who need them, within and across countries, especially those in vulnerable situations or living in poverty", the experts spelt out.

They also called for international cooperation and assistance between developed and developing countries to ensure widespread sharing of technologies and know-how on COVID-19 vaccines and treatment.

Additionally, the experts said that pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility not to put profits ahead of people's rights to life and health and should accept restrictions on the patent protection of vaccines they develop.

"This pandemic has affected the whole world", they reminded. "Now the world must put aside misplaced individual initiatives to monopolize vaccines and supplies, and work together to defeat it".

Independent experts are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a specific human rights theme or a country situation. The experts are not UN staff, nor are they paid for their work. Click here for the experts who signed this statement.

Good news on the horizon

Meanwhile, according to preliminary analysis, the first effective coronavirus vaccine to be developed so far can prevent more than 90 per cent of people from contracting COVID-19.

The pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech, who developed the inoculation, described it as a "great day for science and humanity", according to news reports.

As the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people across six countries with no safety concerns having been raised, the companies plan to take the vaccine to regulators for final approval, with the hope of it being in widespread use before the end of the year.

There are multiple vaccines in the final stages of testing, but this is the first to show results from the phase three trial procedure.

New York attorney general threatens Trump with lawsuit if he denies state access to ‘life-saving’ vaccineMr Trump says state will have to ‘authorise’ delivery of drug or miss outNew York’s attorney general says the state will sue Donald Trump if he tries to prevent it receiving Covid vaccine.

New York’s attorney general says the state will sue Donald Trump if he tries to prevent it receiving the “life-saving” Covid vaccine.

The outgoing president announced that his administration would not deliver the drug to New York when it becomes available next year.

Mr Trump said during a press conference in the White House’s Rose Garden that governor Andrew Cuomo “will have to let us know when he’s ready for it because otherwise, we can’t be delivering it to a state that won’t be giving it to its people immediately.”

The president made the claim as he spoke for the first time publicly in the wake of his defeat to Joe Biden.

“He doesn’t trust where the vaccine is coming from,” added Mr Trump.

“These are coming from the greatest companies anywhere in the world, greatest labs in the world, but he doesn’t trust the fact that it’s this White House, this administration, so we won’t be delivering it to New York until we have authorisation to do so and that pains me to say that.”

New York Attorney general Letitia James immediately took to Twitter to threaten against against Mr Trump.

“Any attempt by Donald Trump to deny New York access to a lifesaving #Covid19 vaccine will be met with a lawsuit, plain and simple. Stop playing politics with people's lives,” she tweeted.

And she added in a statement that Mr Trump’s threats were “nothing more than vindictive behaviour by a lame-duck president trying to extract vengeance on those who oppose his politics.”

Mr Trump told his news conference that the vaccine would be widely available in the US by April.

Story continues

Meanwhile daily cases of the virus hit another all-time high with 176,000 recorded on Friday.

Mr Cuomo also took a shot at Mr Trump and said on MSNBC that “none of what he said is true. Surprise, surprise.”

Pelosi cancels dinner for new members of Congress after Covid backlash led by Chelsea ClintonMs Pelosi’s office tried to defend the dinner, but 90 minutes later said it had been cancelledNancy Pelosi speaking this week (Getty Images)

Nancy Pelosi has called off a dinner for new Democratic members of Congress after a Twitter backlash from people who claimed the meal would flout Covid restrictions.

On the same day that she described the pandemic as an ‘emergency of the highest magnitude’, a photo was posted of the lavish dining room being prepared in the Capitol.

The speaker, 80, had told an NBC reporter that it was safe, and that there was advanced ventilation for the meal and a Capitol physician had signed off on it.

But the planned dinner angered prominent Democrats, who’ve made a point of distinguishing themselves from Republicans in how seriously they take the Covid threat.

They were led by Chelsea Clinton, who tweeted: “Please cancel these in-person dinners, @SpeakerPelosi & @kevinomccarthy to keep everyone safe from #covid19 - yourselves, your new members, servers, the Capitol police and all of their families and contacts. And, to show public health leadership.”

MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes added: “Cancel your precious dinner, you maniacs. my god.”

At first, Ms Pelosi’s office stood by the decision, saying: “Our office strictly follows the guidance of the Office of Attending Physician, including for this dinner. To be a further model for the nation, this event has been modified to allow Members-elect to pick up their meals to go in a socially-distanced manner.”

But 90 minutes later her deputy chief of staff tweeted: “Members-elect are now picking up their boxed meals and departing the Capitol. There is no group dinner. Members-elect are in DC already for orientation.”

WHO director goes into self-quarantine after contact with person exposed to COVID-19The director of the World Health Organization said he will go into self-quarantine after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19.WHO director goes into self-quarantine after contact with person exposed to COVID-19 Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he will work from home.

The director of the World Health Organization tweeted Sunday he will go into self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he is well and not showing symptoms but will be working from home as a precaution.

"It is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of #COVID19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems," he tweeted

Tedros has been the face of WHO's response to the pandemic since the beginning of the year and has been working with government leaders and scientists to control the virus and work on creating a vaccine. He has received criticism from President Donald Trump, who accused the WHO of not being tough enough on China following its late response to the virus.

Tedros and other WHO leaders have urged for unity among the world leaders.

Pfizer says trials show its COVID vaccine "more than 90% effective""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis," Pfizer CEO says.London — U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said Monday that human trials suggest its coronavirus vaccine is 90% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections in people not known to have had the virus already. The pharmaceutical giant said it would be applying for Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA as soon as final data meets safety milestones, which it expects to happen in the third week of November.

"Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine's ability to prevent COVID-19," Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

"We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen. With today's news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis," he continued.

UPDATE: We are proud to announce, along with @BioNTech_Group, that our mRNA-based #vaccine candidate has, at an interim analysis, demonstrated initial evidence of efficacy against #COVID19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

— Pfizer Inc. (@pfizer) November 9, 2020

If approved, the vaccine will require patients to receive two shots, with the second coming 21 days after the first.

"We know it's a two-dose vaccine, so we want to ensure that we can manage the — the delivery of the first dose and ensure the delivery of the second dose — while we simultaneously integrate new rounds of doses being delivered to the American people," General Gus Perna, leader of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government's program to inoculate 300 million Americans against the coronavirus by next spring, told "60 Minutes" on Sunday.

Story continues

Perna said Operation Warp Speed is ready to begin distributing the Pfizer vaccine around the U.S., along with kits of the needles, syringes and alcohol swabs, as soon as it receives federal approval, with doses already stockpiled.

"It's a simple command of, 'Execute,'" he told "60 Minutes."

Pfizer is one of several companies with a vaccine candidate in phase three trials, and it is the only U.S.-based pharmaceutical company to have rejected government funding for the development of its coronavirus vaccine. Bourla said he wanted to shield the pharmaceutical giant from politics.

"I wanted to liberate our scientists from any bureaucracy," he said. "When you get money from someone, that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. I didn't want to have any of that. I wanted them — basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics," he said.

Pfizer did, however, strike a large-scale production and delivery deal with the U.S. government, worth up to $1.95 billion, to secure an initial 100 million doses of its vaccine, following its approval, and the option to purchase 500 million more, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

There will be some obstacles to delivery. Unlike some of the other vaccines in the works, the Pfizer cocktail needs to be kept very cold.

"We have to make sure that we send that particular vaccine to the right places, that either have that capacity or the ability to do the dry ice — that we'll need in order to keep it cold," Paul Ostroswki, Perna's civilian deputy, told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin for his "60 Minutes" report.

In September, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company, which has partnered with German biopharmaceuticals firm BioNTech to make the vaccine, was preparing for approval from the federal government and distribution before the end of the year. He said they had already manufactured hundreds of thousands of doses, though he stopped short of predicting when Americans might get access to the vaccine.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a member of Pfizer's board of directors, cautioned on CBS' "Face the Nation" in September, however, that he did not believe a vaccine would be widely available until 2021.

"This is likely to be a very staged market entry," Gottlieb said. "I think that's what people should expect. But for most people, they will not have access to a vaccine until 2021. I think maybe the first quarter of 2021, probably the first half of 2021. And that's assuming that these vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective in these large trials."

I wanted them — basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics," he said.

Pfizer did, however, strike a large-scale production and delivery deal with the U.S. government, worth up to $1.95 billion, to secure an initial 100 million doses of its vaccine, following its approval, and the option to purchase 500 million more, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

There will be some obstacles to delivery. Unlike some of the other vaccines in the works, the Pfizer cocktail needs to be kept very cold.

"We have to make sure that we send that particular vaccine to the right places, that either have that capacity or the ability to do the dry ice — that we'll need in order to keep it cold," Paul Ostroswki, Perna's civilian deputy, told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin for his "60 Minutes" report.

In September, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company, which has partnered with German biopharmaceuticals firm BioNTech to make the vaccine, was preparing for approval from the federal government and distribution before the end of the year. He said they had already manufactured hundreds of thousands of doses, though he stopped short of predicting when Americans might get access to the vaccine.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a member of Pfizer's board of directors, cautioned on CBS' "Face the Nation" in September, however, that he did not believe a vaccine would be widely available until 2021.

"This is likely to be a very staged market entry," Gottlieb said. "I think that's what people should expect. But for most people, they will not have access to a vaccine until 2021. I think maybe the first quarter of 2021, probably the first half of 2021. And that's assuming that these vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective in these large trials."

COVID-19 vaccine could fundamentally change pandemic direction - WHO - ReutersA COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.GENEVA (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.

Bruce Aylward told the WHO's annual ministerial assembly that interim results from Pfizer Inc's PFE.N late-stage vaccine trial were "very positive".

“There is still much work to be done, this is just interim results...but some very positive results coming today which should hold great promise hopefully for the entire world as we move forward,” Aylward told the 194-member state forum.

“By March as a result of the extraordinary work happening globally we could be in a position to fundamentally change the direction and the dynamic of this crisis,” he added.

Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, raising hope as the pandemic accelerates with over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also welcomed the “encouraging vaccine news” in a tweet.

The Pfizer-BioNTech candidate was not among the original nine vaccines forming part of a WHO-run “COVAX” facility to finance and distribute them fairly around the world.

However, the companies have expressed interest in supplying the programme. The WHO has said more vaccines are under consideration.

Pfizer and BioNTech said they expected to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine, raising the possibility of a regulatory decision as soon as December.

Aylward gave an upbeat assessment of overall prospects.

“In diagnostics we are in a position to massively expand testing globally, in therapeutics we have sufficient tools right now to substantially reduce the risk of dying from this disease and in the area of vaccines - with the news of today especially - we are on the verge of having the readiness in place to roll out doses for high-risk populations in the late first quarter, early 2nd quarter.”

However, he warned that an “acute funding gap” of $4.5 billion could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.COVID-19 vaccine could fundamentally change pandemic direction - WHO - ReutersA COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.GENEVA (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.

An infectious disease modelling expert says more needs to be done as B.C. continues to see rising COVID-19 numbers

VICTORIA (NEWS 1130) – Is B.C. doing enough to fight COVID-19? That’s the question being put to an infectious disease modeller, who says that depends on what it is you’re looking to achieve.

“Enough for what? Enough to control cases? No, we haven’t been doing enough,” COVID-19 data modelling expert Caroline Colijn tells NEWS 1130.

“Enough to keep everything sort of under ICU capacity until today? Yes, I guess so, that’s enough. But where it goes from here is of course hard. So, are we doing enough? I guess the answer’s going to depend on, what’s enough? Enough for what?”

Colijn , who didn’t put together the information released by the province on Thursday, points to “sustained, rapid, community transmission of COVID,” particularly on the Lower Mainland, as one of the major concerns, saying more action needs to be taken ahead of the winter.

“Are we doing enough to keep workplaces open? I mean, it’s a hard question because, enough for what?”

What is clear, she says, is the rate by which the virus is spreading right now isn’t something we can continue to see happening. She notes we also can’t just wait for a vaccine to make everything better.

“It’s going too fast. We need to change something,” Colijn says.

British Columbians and Canadians across the country continue to be reminded to keep their social bubbles small to help prevent further spread of the virus, with some provinces enacting partial lockdowns in order to compel people to do just that.

However, in B.C., there continues to only be an order in place for the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions, restricting gatherings until Nov. 23. With Diwali on Saturday, concerns are mounting that some may ignore public health direction, potentially creating some challenging days ahead.

The Canadian Medical Association warns the country is at a “tipping point” and not enough is being down to mitigate the virus.

Colijn admits it’s tough to determine what to do at this point but she says options are still available, suggesting it could be time to consider breaking the curve with targeted, week-by-week clampdowns to keep the virus under control.

“I would start thinking about what we could do that would be somewhat more planned, to say, ‘OK, we’re going to have one week out of four, two weeks out of six, or whatever, where we really close things down, but we know we’re going to do it,’ maybe that would be more palatable,” she explains.

However, one thing Colijn says is necessary is to not take a wait-and-see approach.

“We don’t have to wait for Europe, the U.K., the U.S., Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and Alberta to do this first. We don’t have to wait for their mistakes and make the same ones,” Colijn says. “If we control it, it’ll go up and down. If we don’t do anything, it’ll go up and up and up, right? Whether we see that up and down depends on us.”

Reducing social contact

Many have asked why B.C. doesn’t follow in other provinces’ footsteps by bringing in a more strict lockdown.

Colijn says, while she isn’t privy to exactly how decisions are made on the provincial level, she believes a total shutdown in B.C. isn’t on the table at this moment due to just how devastating it was on the economy in the spring.

“They want to keep as much open as possible and we’re trying to navigate how to do that and trying to keep as many workplaces and businesses open as possible,” she tells NEWS 1130. “And I suspect that’s why we’re testing the waters with, ‘Maybe if we ask people to stop socializing in their homes, that’ll work.'”

Again, she believes more should be done to prevent further spread of COVID-19, including by addressing unnecessary indoor social contact.

“If there’s indoor social contact that we don’t need to do and we can function just as well without it, now would be a great time — two weeks ago would have been a better time — but now would be the second best time to start doing that and return to work from home where possible,” she says.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced on Thursday that B.C. had recorded 594 new cases over a 24-hour period between Nov. 11 and Nov. 12, setting yet another provincial record. That’s on top of the 536 cases reported between Tuesday and Wednesday.

Presenting the latest modelling data on Thursday, Henry said the primary driver of transmission in this province has been gatherings in households and in the community.

“We don’t put in those measures to keep us safe that we do in other settings” at these private homes, Henry said, adding getting control of the pandemic is at risk of getting out of hand.

With cooler weather setting in, the concern is only growing further.

Among the scores of companies the US government is working with to find effective COVID-19 treatments, one biotech firm stands out.

Humanigen entered 2020 with two full-time employees, $214,000 in cash, and a history that included a bankruptcy filing and a CEO stint by "Pharma Bro" Martin Shkreli. Its research on a potential cancer treatment was still far from producing any clear signs of success, and its shares were stuck in penny-stock territory.

Then the pandemic struck, and Humanigen's executives turned to a classic biotech strategy to reinvigorate the company. Turning to Twitter and a Fox News appearance, they pitched the company's investigational cancer drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19, ultimately raising more than $140 million off the prospects for commercial success.

Five years after Shkreli's ill-fated run at the company, Humanigen now has the chance to shake the Pharma Bro's shadow.

But the biggest question remains unanswered: does the drug work? So far, the company has touted anecdotal success stories instead of rigorous data from well-designed trials, and it's repeatedly pushed back the timeline for a trial that could provide a definitive answer.

Up until November 6, investors were expecting results from that late-stage study before year's end. But Humanigen CEO Cameron Durrant told Business Insider the company now no longer expects to meet that timeline, as the study is anticipated to continue into 2021. That timeline could make the drug less valuable, as it's possible people could start receiving an effective coronavirus vaccine by next year.

One investor urged caution in leaning on companies of Humanigen's size to fix a public health emergency.

"Smaller companies, in general, are not reliable in a four-alarm fire emergency like we have right now," said Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments and a longtime biotech investor.

A checkered past marred by Martin Shkreli and bankruptcy

After 15 years of mainly trying and failing to develop drugs, Humanigen, known in 2015 as KaloBios, waved the white flag.

Martin Shkreli had other plans. With a group of investors, he acquired a controlling stake in November 2015 and became CEO, touting the potential of the same drug the company is now testing in coronavirus patients.

"I'm happy to save this company from the brink," Shkreli said at the time, according to FierceBiotech. "They announced they were going to shut down, and I came in and said, 'No, you're not.'"

By then, Shkreli was already notorious for his strategy of jacking up prices on decades-old medications with limited or no competition. His reign at KaloBios lasted about a month.

He was ousted shortly after being arrested on unrelated securities fraud charges. He was sentenced for defrauding investors and is currently in prison.

At the end of 2015, KaloBios went down as well, filing for bankruptcy.

KaloBios re-emerged in 2016 with a new management team, and it no longer has ties to Shkreli.

That's a point his successor, Durrant, emphasizes. Durrant is a 25-year drug-industry veteran.

The company is "180-degrees different from Martin Shkreli and people like him," he said.

Durrant renamed the company Humanigen in 2017.

Pandemic offers opportunity for a troubled biotech

Humanigen's prized possession is an experimental drug called lenzilumab, or Lenz for short.

Lenz failed a mid-stage study in asthma in 2014. While the company then switched to working on a different drug, those plans didn't pan out over the next few years, leaving Durrant to focus back on Lenz.

The company started testing the compound in 2016 in patients with a rare form of the blood cancer leukemia. So far, studies have been too small and limited to tell if it can help cancer patients.

Lenz aims to inhibit a small protein in our bloodstream called GM-CSF. Researchers have identified this protein as playing a role in conditions like arthritis and multiple sclerosis, as well.

Headed into 2020, Humanigen was burning through cash and was nowhere close to figuring out if Lenz could work as a cancer treatment.

The pandemic provided an opportunity to flip the script. Physicians noticed the sickest COVID-19 patients suffered more from an overreactive immune system than the actual viral infection. Humanigen started testing Lenz in March as a coronavirus drug, hoping it can tamp down that haywire immune response.

There's a scientific rationale for testing the drug, said John Rizk, a clinical researcher at Arizona State University who wrote a review of the research space in July.

Even though other anti-inflammatory drugs have disappointed in COVID-19, particularly a class of medicines called IL-6 inhibitors, Rizk said this is because those proteins are involved later on in the immune response than GM-CSF.

Other drugmakers also testing GM-CSF antibodies against COVID-19 include GlaxoSmithKline, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Roivant Sciences, and I-Mab.

Investor excitement built as Humanigen touted anecdotes of success, particularly a write-up from Mayo Clinic doctors in June describing 12 patients who got Lenz, where 11 improved. The stock climbed from roughly $5 to $25 that month.

Shares peaked in July, with the company's valuation exceeding $1 billion, more than 10 times what it was at the beginning of the year.

In late July, the US National Institutes of Health selected Lenz for a mid-stage trial involving 200 patients with COVID-19. The other treatments NIH is testing come from drug industry giants like Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Durrant said he believes the decision to include Lenz was based on science. He did not specify if the company provided the NIH with additional data beyond the limited Mayo Clinic study.

"I can't speak to the data that people viewed," he said. "What I can tell you is we believe this is a science-driven decision."

Anecdotes aren't data, as timelines stumble backwards

While the Mayo Clinic report stoked enthusiasm for Lenz, it doesn't actually tell us much about whether the drug works.

Just 12 patients got the treatment, and their results weren't compared to a group who got a placebo. That's particularly important in coronavirus trials, since most COVID-19 patients recover on their own. Plus, some patients received other drugs, including the antiviral remdesivir, steroids, hydroxychloroquine, or the arthritis drug Actemra.

Because of these limitations, Rizk said these results are "not really reliable."

"Until we have the results available from placebo-controlled trials, we must not overstretch our therapeutic stance," Rizk said.

Even so, Humanigen has emphasized the findings on multiple calls with investors and in press releases, calling them exciting and promising.

Humanigen has been running a late-stage trial since May that should provide more definitive results. In it, 300 hospitalized coronavirus patients are supposed to receive either Lenz or a placebo.

But the company has repeatedly pushed back the timeline for delivering results from that study.

In July, the company said it would finish the study by the end of September, soon enough to get the drug approved and launched before year's end.

In August, the company said it would finish enrolling patients by the end of September, delaying the trial's conclusion.

Humanigen failed to meet that enrollment timeline. Durrant blamed a declining incidence rate of COVID-19 in September, although the number of new daily cases stayed relatively stable throughout the month.

The company announced on October 2 plans to open trial sites in Brazil and Mexico.

One Humanigen investor, who asked not to be identified because they consult on several COVID-19 drug and vaccine projects, said that delay was the final straw. The person exited their position in Humanigen when Durrant outlined plans to open research sites in Brazil.

"When you invest in a company, one of the important things is management," they said. "If they aren't shooting straight with you, it usually doesn't work out well even if they have a good drug. It's hard to get visibility on this company and that may be somewhat intentional."

In early November, Humanigen said it had recruited 300 people for its study but hasn't completed enrollment — the study had been expanded in size to 515 patients. While the company provided a rough estimate that "suggests" Lenz is helping patients, it's far from concrete proof. Independent statisticians criticized the disclosure, calling it inappropriate, STAT's Matthew Herper reported.

And the timeline keeps slipping. The company now says it plans to file for emergency use authorization in the first quarter of 2021 after an interim analysis or completing the study. Durrant acknowledged the company no longer expects definitive results before year's end.

A focus on retail investors, stirred by Fox News and Twitter

Humanigen CEO Cameron Durrant on Fox News Fox News

Just as Humanigen rolled back its timelines in early October, President Donald Trump was being admitted to the hospital for COVID-19. Durrant and the company saw an opportunity.

When major news outlets such as CNN, The New York Times, and BBC News tweeted about the president's health condition, the company's Twitter account repeatedly responded.

Humanigen was promoting its experimental drug, saying it "decreased risk of death/ventilation by 80% for #COVID19 patients hospitalized on supplemental oxygen," and linking to the Mayo Clinic report.

The unusual social-media promotion was topped by Durrant going on Fox News, telling TV host Tucker Carlson about the promise of Lenz.

"We've seen data, very exciting data, Tucker, published from the Mayo Clinic that showed that in patients who received lenzilumab, those patients had an 80% reduction in risk of ventilation or death," Durrant said, without mentioning the limitations of those findings.

Trump didn't receive Lenz. Instead, he got Gilead's remdesivir, Regeneron's experimental antibody cocktail, and the steroid dexamethasone.

The biotech investor Loncar said the Twitter tactics and Fox News appearance are "tell-stage signs" of a biotech trying to entice non-specialist investors.

"These are things that have no bearing on a sophisticated, professional life sciences investor," Loncar said. "That's to catch the general public-type investor."How a tiny biotech rebounded from bankruptcy and Martin Shkreli at the helm to convince the NIH to bet on its unproven coronavirus drugSummary List Placement

"I'm happy to save this company from the brink," Shkreli said at the time, according to FierceBiotech. "They announced they were going to shut down, and I came in and said, 'No, you're not.'"

By then, Shkreli was already notorious for his strategy of jacking up prices on decades-old medications with limited or no competition. His reign at KaloBios lasted about a month.

He was ousted shortly after being arrested on unrelated securities fraud charges. He was sentenced for defrauding investors and is currently in prison.

At the end of 2015, KaloBios went down as well, filing for bankruptcy.

KaloBios re-emerged in 2016 with a new management team, and it no longer has ties to Shkreli.

That's a point his successor, Durrant, emphasizes. Durrant is a 25-year drug-industry veteran.

The company is "180-degrees different from Martin Shkreli and people like him," he said.

Durrant renamed the company Humanigen in 2017.

Pandemic offers opportunity for a troubled biotech

Humanigen's prized possession is an experimental drug called lenzilumab, or Lenz for short.

Lenz failed a mid-stage study in asthma in 2014. While the company then switched to working on a different drug, those plans didn't pan out over the next few years, leaving Durrant to focus back on Lenz.

The company started testing the compound in 2016 in patients with a rare form of the blood cancer leukemia. So far, studies have been too small and limited to tell if it can help cancer patients.

Lenz aims to inhibit a small protein in our bloodstream called GM-CSF. Researchers have identified this protein as playing a role in conditions like arthritis and multiple sclerosis, as well.

Headed into 2020, Humanigen was burning through cash and was nowhere close to figuring out if Lenz could work as a cancer treatment.

The pandemic provided an opportunity to flip the script. Physicians noticed the sickest COVID-19 patients suffered more from an overreactive immune system than the actual viral infection. Humanigen started testing Lenz in March as a coronavirus drug, hoping it can tamp down that haywire immune response.

There's a scientific rationale for testing the drug, said John Rizk, a clinical researcher at Arizona State University who wrote a review of the research space in July.

Even though other anti-inflammatory drugs have disappointed in COVID-19, particularly a class of medicines called IL-6 inhibitors, Rizk said this is because those proteins are involved later on in the immune response than GM-CSF.

Other drugmakers also testing GM-CSF antibodies against COVID-19 include GlaxoSmithKline, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Roivant Sciences, and I-Mab.

Investor excitement built as Humanigen touted anecdotes of success, particularly a write-up from Mayo Clinic doctors in June describing 12 patients who got Lenz, where 11 improved. The stock climbed from roughly $5 to $25 that month.

Shares peaked in July, with the company's valuation exceeding $1 billion, more than 10 times what it was at the beginning of the year.

In late July, the US National Institutes of Health selected Lenz for a mid-stage trial involving 200 patients with COVID-19. The other treatments NIH is testing come from drug industry giants like Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, and Bristol Myers Squibb.

Durrant said he believes the decision to include Lenz was based on science. He did not specify if the company provided the NIH with additional data beyond the limited Mayo Clinic study.

"I can't speak to the data that people viewed," he said. "What I can tell you is we believe this is a science-driven decision."

Anecdotes aren't data, as timelines stumble backwards

While the Mayo Clinic report stoked enthusiasm for Lenz, it doesn't actually tell us much about whether the drug works.

Just 12 patients got the treatment, and their results weren't compared to a group who got a placebo. That's particularly important in coronavirus trials, since most COVID-19 patients recover on their own. Plus, some patients received other drugs, including the antiviral remdesivir, steroids, hydroxychloroquine, or the arthritis drug Actemra.

Because of these limitations, Rizk said these results are "not really reliable."

"Until we have the results available from placebo-controlled trials, we must not overstretch our therapeutic stance," Rizk said.

Even so, Humanigen has emphasized the findings on multiple calls with investors and in press releases, calling them exciting and promising.

Humanigen has been running a late-stage trial since May that should provide more definitive results. In it, 300 hospitalized coronavirus patients are supposed to receive either Lenz or a placebo.

But the company has repeatedly pushed back the timeline for delivering results from that study.

In July, the company said it would finish the study by the end of September, soon enough to get the drug approved and launched before year's end.

In August, the company said it would finish enrolling patients by the end of September, delaying the trial's conclusion.

Humanigen failed to meet that enrollment timeline. Durrant blamed a declining incidence rate of COVID-19 in September, although the number of new daily cases stayed relatively stable throughout the month.

The company announced on October 2 plans to open trial sites in Brazil and Mexico.

One Humanigen investor, who asked not to be identified because they consult on several COVID-19 drug and vaccine projects, said that delay was the final straw. The person exited their position in Humanigen when Durrant outlined plans to open research sites in Brazil.

"When you invest in a company, one of the important things is management," they said. "If they aren't shooting straight with you, it usually doesn't work out well even if they have a good drug. It's hard to get visibility on this company and that may be somewhat intentional."

In early November, Humanigen said it had recruited 300 people for its study but hasn't completed enrollment — the study had been expanded in size to 515 patients. While the company provided a rough estimate that "suggests" Lenz is helping patients, it's far from concrete proof. Independent statisticians criticized the disclosure, calling it inappropriate, STAT's Matthew Herper reported.

And the timeline keeps slipping. The company now says it plans to file for emergency use authorization in the first quarter of 2021 after an interim analysis or completing the study. Durrant acknowledged the company no longer expects definitive results before year's end.

A focus on retail investors, stirred by Fox News and Twitter

Humanigen CEO Cameron Durrant on Fox News Fox News

Just as Humanigen rolled back its timelines in early October, President Donald Trump was being admitted to the hospital for COVID-19. Durrant and the company saw an opportunity.

When major news outlets such as CNN, The New York Times, and BBC News tweeted about the president's health condition, the company's Twitter account repeatedly responded.

Humanigen was promoting its experimental drug, saying it "decreased risk of death/ventilation by 80% for #COVID19 patients hospitalized on supplemental oxygen," and linking to the Mayo Clinic report.

The unusual social-media promotion was topped by Durrant going on Fox News, telling TV host Tucker Carlson about the promise of Lenz.

"We've seen data, very exciting data, Tucker, published from the Mayo Clinic that showed that in patients who received lenzilumab, those patients had an 80% reduction in risk of ventilation or death," Durrant said, without mentioning the limitations of those findings.

Trump didn't receive Lenz. Instead, he got Gilead's remdesivir, Regeneron's experimental antibody cocktail, and the steroid dexamethasone.

The biotech investor Loncar said the Twitter tactics and Fox News appearance are "tell-stage signs" of a biotech trying to entice non-specialist investors.

"These are things that have no bearing on a sophisticated, professional life sciences investor," Loncar said. "That's to catch the general public-type investor."

New Jersey governor says ‘second wave is here’ as New York mayor says city is at ‘a dangerous moment’The mayor of New York City has warned that the city is getting “dangerously close” to a second wave of coronavirus infections, as the United States passed 10 million cases and public health experts warned that the country is entering the pandemic’s worst phas…Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, on Monday warned the city was ‘dangerously close’ to a second wave (AP)

The mayor of New York City has warned that the city is getting “dangerously close” to a second wave of coronavirus infections, as the United States passed 10 million cases and public health experts warned that the country is entering the pandemic’s worst phase.

On the day that Pfizer announced highly promising results of its vaccine trials, states across the midwest were being deluged with new cases.

The governor of Utah declared a statewide emergency and issued a mask mandate - after months of resisting the move.

Cabinet member Ben Carson, Donald Trump’s secretary of housing and urban development, announced that he had tested positive, after attending the White House’s Tuesday night election results party. His diagnosis followed that of David Bossie, the head of the Trump campaign’s legal campaign, and, on Friday night, Mr Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Joe Biden, the president-elect, on Monday held the first meeting of his coronavirus taskforce, knowing that getting the pandemic under control would be one of his most immediate priorities.

New York City

Bill de Blasio, mayor of the nation’s most populous city, warned on Monday that Covid-19 was “trying to reassert itself,” and urged residents to take the pandemic seriously or face a second lockdown.

“We need to do everything in our power to stop the coronavirus from reasserting in New York City," he said.

"We have to stop a second wave from happening here, it is getting dangerously close.”

Wild scenes of jubilation erupted on Saturday when Mr Biden was declared the winner, leading some public health experts to warn the public to expect a second wave. The celebrations were in the streets, however, and many people were wearing face masks to reduce the risks.

“We can stop a second wave if we act immediately, but we have one last chance and everyone has to be a part of it," said Mr de Blasio.

New York’s positivity rate now exceeds two per cent, he said.

The city’s seven-day rolling average of new virus cases is at 779 — 229 more than the city’s warning threshold of 550 cases.

Story continues

The citywide infection rate on a seven-day rolling average is at 2.21 percent, while the daily percentage of people testing positive citywide is at 2.36 per cent, the data shows.

Additionally, 71 people were admitted to city hospitals with suspected Covid-19.

Health officials rolled out a new Covid map for the city on Monday, allowing residents to input their zip codes and see the level of infections.

Mr de Blasio said that New Yorkers had to accept that Thanksgiving and Christmas would be different this year, and repeated his plea that people do not travel to visit relatives.

“The holidays we associate with travel, and the holidays we associate with indoor gatherings, big meals together — that, unfortunately, this year cannot be the case,” he said.

It’s “not yet time” for broader restrictions, the mayor said, but said he felt indoor dining should be re-evaluated. Currently, indoor dining remains at 25 per cent capacity at restaurants across the five boroughs.

New Jersey

Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, announced on Monday that bars and restaurants must stop their indoor services by 10pm, telling the residents of his state: "A second wave is here. This is our reality."

Under the new rules, to take effect on Thursday, bars and restaurants will be able to seat groups of diners closer together as long as plexiglass separates them.

The clampdown on social activities comes as New Jersey’s coronavirus cases reach highs on par with those in April and May.

The state reported more than 2,000 cases on Sunday, making the state’s overall total since early March more than 254,500, according to Washington Post data.

NEW: We’re taking action to stop the spread of #COVID19.



Effective Thursday, November 12th:

☑️No indoor dining between 10:00 PM – 5:00 AM at restaurants, bars, clubs, and lounges

☑️Outdoor dining, takeout, and delivery services may continue past 10:00 PM — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) November 9, 2020

Utah

A mask mandate went into force at 1pm on Monday after the Republican governor, Gary Herbert, declared a state of emergency on Sunday.

In the past two weeks, Utah’s positivity average — the percentage of coronavirus tests that are positive — has increased from 18.5 per cent to 20.6 per cent, according to state data.

At least 659 state residents have died of the coronavirus and more than 132,000 have been infected.

Utah’s largest teachers union called on Friday for the governor to mandate that all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas shift to remote learning, a move which Mr Herbert has so far resisted.

"Masks do not negatively affect our economy, and wearing them is the easiest way to slow the spread of the virus," the governor said. "We cannot afford to debate this issue any longer. Individual freedom is certainly important, and it is our rule of law that protects that freedom."

Mr Herbert added: "Laws are put in places to protect all of us. That's why we have traffic lights, speed limits and seatbelts, and that's why we now have a mask mandate."

Minnesota

The governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, said on Monday that the state is prepared to enact some "surgical" dial-back measures aimed at young people, as the state continued to wrestle with new cases - and deaths and hospitalisations continue to break records.

"We have reached a very dangerous phase in the pandemic in the upper Midwest and now into Minnesota," said Mr Walz said Monday.

On Sunday, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) reported 5,924 new cases across the state, by far the highest single-day total yet and the fifth new single-day high in a row.

Asked if Minnesota was considering a second lockdown, he replied: "We are prepared to take some steps."

Mr Walz said that would not necessarily mean a second lockdown.

"That's a pretty blunt instrument to attack Covid-19," he said. “It was the right tool early on because it allowed us to build up PPE (personal protective equipment).”

FXB: Liquidity Could Continue To Support The Pound In The Short RunPositive news regarding the Covid19 vaccine combined with more easing to be announced by central banks in December should compress volatility in the short term.Hence, rising liquidity should support FXB in the coming weeks; our first target is at 130, which has acted as a strong resistance in the past two years.

Positive news regarding the Covid19 vaccine combined with more easing to be announced by central banks in December should compress volatility in the short term.

About FXY

The Invesco CurrencyShares British pound Sterling Trust ETF (FXB) is an exchange-traded fund incorporated in the USA, designed to track the price of the British pound against the US dollar. The fund is rebalanced quarterly.

Introduction

In the past few weeks, there have been some dramatic changes in the macro environment that should influence the dynamics of the FX market in the near term. We think that the positive news regarding the Covid19 vaccine combined with more easing that will be announced by central banks in December (both ECB and Fed) could compress the price volatility and also weigh on the US dollar in the coming weeks. We are still not convinced that the USD will continue its bearish momentum in the coming 12 to 18 months as non-US central banks will eventually counter the trend by announcing more drastic measures, but we do think that there is some room for some risk-on currencies such as the British pound to appreciate in the short run.

Figure 1 shows the recent history of the exchange rate in recent years and how vulnerable the pound is to market shocks and equity drawdowns. The first resistance on the upside stands at 1.34, followed by the 1.40-1.44 LT resistance zone.

Figure 1

Liquidity will compress volatility this winter

With most of the European economies under national lockdown, which is expected to be soon announced in the US, central banks will announce more easing measures in their December meeting (December 10th for the ECB and December 16th for the Fed) in order to assist the economies during the winter. We think that the extension of the emergency QE programs should continue to compress volatility and, therefore, weaken the greenback in the coming weeks. Hence, risk-on currencies such as Cable could experience a little rally in the near term as the pound is generally performing well in low-volatility regime.

Figure 2 (left frame) shows the strong co-movement between Cable and US equities in the recent two years; higher equities have generally coincided with a stronger pound and vice versa. If we look back at the past 30 years of data, we can notice that investors have generally sold their pound aggressively in periods of high volatility. Figure 2 (right frame) shows the monthly average performance of the most liquid currencies relative to the dollar when the VIX rises above 20 since 1990; the pound has averaged -30bps in monthly returns when the VIX was high.

Figure 2

Drivers of FXB

Another important driver of currencies in the medium term is the real interest rate differential; figure 3 shows strong co-movement between the 2Y UK-US real interest rate differential and FXB in the past cycle. Even though we saw a divergence between the two times series in the 18 months preceding the pandemic, the significant fall in US real yields relative to other economies have weighed on the greenback in the past 8 months. Hence, the positive spread between the UK and the US should continue to favor FXB in the near term.

Participants have been concerned about the Brexit uncertainty for the pound and, therefore, have been trying to avoid having a currency exposure in the current environment, especially considering how sensitive Cable is to equity moves. We do expect to see other currency selloffs in the future, but we do think that FXB will enjoy a little bull period in the coming weeks due to the compressed volatility and weak USD.

Figure 3

Source: Eikon Reuters, RR calculations

Outlook on FXB

Figure 4 shows that FXB has experienced several shocks in the past 13 years and is currently trading at a very low level relative to history. The 115-120 seems to be the lower band on FXB; unless we see another drastic selloff in equities (which is very unlikely), FXB should not trade below 120 in the near term. Our first target on FXB is 130, which has been an important resistance in the past two years, and we think that more momentum in equities could push FXB above that level in the coming weeks.

Momentum indicators such as moving average crossovers are also sending positive signals on FXB and, therefore, the momentum we have seen in the past 8 months should continue.

GENEVA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday. Bruce Aylward also told the WHO's annual ministerial assembly that interim results announced from Pfizer Inc's late-stage vaccine trials were "very positive".

"There is still much work to be done, this is just interim results...but some very positive results coming today which should hold great promise hopefully for the entire world as we move forward," Aylward told the 194-member state forum.

Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine with partner BioNTech was more than 90% effective.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted shortly afterwards: "We welcome the encouraging vaccine news from @pfizer & @BioNTech_Group & salute all scientists & partners around the who are developing new safe, efficacious tools to beat #COVID19.'

Aylward, referring to all three pillars of the ACT (Access to COVID Tools) Accelerator launched in April, said: "In diagnostics we are in a position to massively expand testing globally, in therapeutics we have sufficient tools right now to substantially reduce the risk of dying from this disease and in the area of vaccines - with the news of today especially - we are on the verge of having the readiness in place to roll out doses for high-risk populations in the late first quarter, early 2nd quarter."

However, he warned that an "acute funding gap" of $4.5 billion could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.

Aylward, referring to all three pillars of the ACT (Access to COVID Tools) Accelerator launched in April, said: "In diagnostics we are in a position to massively expand testing globally, in therapeutics we have sufficient tools right now to substantially reduce the risk of dying from this disease and in the area of vaccines - with the news of today especially - we are on the verge of having the readiness in place to roll out doses for high-risk populations in the late first quarter, early 2nd quarter."

However, he warned that an "acute funding gap" of $4.5 billion could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.

What Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine results mean for ending the pandemicModerna says its Covid-19 vaccine is 94.5 percent effective. Here’s what you need to know.The biotech firm Moderna announced Monday that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, was shown to be 94.5 percent effective in protecting volunteers in a clinical trial against the disease.

“This is a pivotal moment in the development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” said Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, in a statement. “This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease.”

It’s more good news following Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement of positive results from their Covid-19 vaccine candidate trial a week ago. But unlike Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna offered far more information about the recipients of the vaccine, showing its efficacy across different ages and ethnic groups. And its results offer a brighter ray of hope for rolling out a vaccine in 2021 as the United States faces its worst stretch of the pandemic yet, with record numbers of new cases and hospitalizations.

The announcements also mean that the world will likely have more than one highly effective vaccine for Covid-19, and the end of the pandemic could be on the horizon. High efficacy also means that fewer people would need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, the threshold at which the virus can no longer spread easily from person to person.

Very exciting to see 94% efficacy of @moderna_tx #SARSCoV2 vaccine at interim analysis of 95 events. This replication of Pfizer's high efficacy tells us the virus is eminently vaccinatable. https://t.co/YpxQdkyUjF — Eric Topol (@EricTopol) November 16, 2020

However, there are some caveats: The results are preliminary, the vaccine requires two doses, there are some side effects, the clinical trial isn’t complete, and the findings were announced in a press release instead of a peer-reviewed paper. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.

And while demonstrating high efficacy is important, the road to getting millions of people vaccinated is fraught with logistical challenges. While this is an important result, a lot of difficult work on a Covid-19 vaccine still lies ahead.

How Moderna showed that its Covid-19 vaccine works

Moderna’s announcement of almost 95 percent efficacy is based on a phase 3 clinical trial. In particular, the results are from the COVE study, conducted in collaboration with the US government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

Phase 3 is where the vaccine is tested against the virus spreading in the real world. Since experimenters can’t deliberately infect people, they have to wait and see who gets sick with Covid-19 in their volunteer pool, comparing the group that received the actual vaccine to the group that received the placebo. Moderna’s vaccine is administered as two doses spaced four weeks apart.

To speed up the process, researchers recruit thousands of volunteers so that the rate of accumulating infections goes up. But it only takes a handful of infections to demonstrate that the vaccine works.

Of course, I'll start with the topline result of 94.5% efficacy (90 placebo cases, 5 vaccinated cases). For a high efficacy vaccine, 95 cases is a lot of data. In event-driven trials, the number of cases matters more than the number of participants. 2/10https://t.co/fTEB6homTT — Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) November 16, 2020

“If the vaccine doesn’t work at all, and 50 percent of people are in the vaccine group, 50 percent in the placebo group, we expect cases to be evenly split across the groups,” explained Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, in an email. “When the vaccine is working, we observe fewer cases in the vaccine group.”

According to Moderna, experimenters detected 95 Covid-19 cases, of which 90 cases were in the placebo group compared to five cases in the group that received the actual vaccine. The results show that the virus was spreading among volunteers in the clinical trial but it was drastically lower among those who received Moderna’s vaccine.

Why Moderna’s results, while preliminary, are still important and exciting

There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure that vaccine manufacturers are not gaming the results.

In a clinical trial like this, neither the company nor the volunteers know who received the vaccine and who received the placebo. This is known as a double-blind study and is considered the gold standard for clinical research. It’s done to prevent either side from changing their behavior or biasing the trial in a deliberate or unconscious way. Someone who knows they received the actual vaccine may engage in riskier behavior, for example, or the company may be tempted to give the vaccine to people already at lower risk of exposure to boost the apparent efficacy.

Instead, there’s a group of independent scientists known as the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that serves as an intermediary between the volunteers and the experimenters. The DSMB knows who received what among the volunteers but doesn’t disclose that to the company right away. Instead, the members monitor the trial pool to ensure there are no severe complications and can stop the trial if there are any problems.

The DSMB then convenes with the company and experimenters at predetermined checkpoints, namely when a certain number of infections are detected. The recent vaccine announcements from Moderna and from Pfizer and BioNTech both emerged from such a preliminary meeting, both at roughly the 95 infection checkpoint. While these results are not peer-reviewed per se, implicit in these announcements is that a group of independent scientists have verified these results. That’s why many scientists who have been paying attention to these clinical trials are so excited about the findings, even though they are preliminary.

“The vaccine is on its way, folks, so hang in there, hang tough,” Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, said last week in response to the Pfizer and BioNTech announcement. “We’re going to get over this together.”

Moderna expects the final analysis of its clinical trial to be conducted when 151 Covid-19 infections are confirmed in the trial pool. It’s hard to say when it will get that many cases, but given the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 in the United States, it’s likely to happen within the next two months.

There are some caveats to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine results

Moderna’s results were announced in a press release — like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine results, Moderna’s announcement came directly from the company itself. There have been several peer-reviewed interim studies about its mRNA-1273 vaccine, but Monday’s efficacy announcement didn’t come with any published data.

Caution: this is a press release not a scientific paper. Looking forward to more detailed efficacy and safety data e.g. https://t.co/DQctLPM0li — Saad B. Omer (@SaadOmer3) November 16, 2020

That doesn’t mean the results are wrong, but they are only a snapshot in time, and without more details, it’s hard to unpack critical nuances needed to interpret them, like what kinds of underlying health conditions influence the efficacy of a vaccine.

These for-profit companies also have a financial incentive to play up good news and smooth over any bumps on the road to an approved vaccine. As the trial proceeds, the results could be reinforced or undermined.

“When we do finally have a viable Covid-19 immunization, the public needs to be able to trust that it’s safe and effective,” wrote Vox’s Julia Belluz. “And the road to building that confidence isn’t paved with preliminary, sparsely detailed news releases that are later overturned when the real work of vetting the vaccines is done.”

But as mentioned above, the fact that these results have independent validation gives them more weight. So there is cause for optimism and skepticism.

Moderna revealed some of the demographics of who is in its trial pool, but more information is still needed; it’s unlikely that a vaccine will be equally effective in all groups of people, so it’s important to pay close attention to the demographics of who gets sick and who gets protected in a vaccine trial.

According to Moderna, the 95 Covid-19 cases were detected in 15 adults over the age of 65 and 20 participants identifying as having a minority background, including 12 Hispanic or Latinx people, four Black or African American people, three Asian American people, and one multiracial person. This shows that the trial recruited a broad spectrum of participants.

This is immensely valuable information for public health and can help guide a vaccination strategy. But health officials still need more information about things like preexisting conditions in the trial pool and the amount of exposure to the virus people experienced.

There are some side effects — Moderna said volunteers generally tolerated their vaccine pretty well, and most problems tended to be mild to moderate.

Nice safety profile, and participants will continue to be followed. Remember - evaluation of vaccine safety never stops, even after vaccines are approved and deployed. We have an adverse event reporting system to continually monitor all vaccines. 7/10 pic.twitter.com/ynGsXjArei — Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) November 16, 2020

Reported problems included injection site pain (2.7 percent) after the first dose, and after the second dose, recipients reported fatigue (9.7 percent), muscle pain (8.9 percent), arthralgia (5.2 percent), headache (4.5 percent), pain (4.1 percent) and redness at the injection site (2 percent), with some overlap in these numbers among patients who experienced more than one effect. Most of these effects were short-lived. A final safety evaluation will still be needed once the trial is run to completion.

While these effects are fairly mild, it’s important to pay close attention to them since vaccines will ultimately have to be distributed to millions, if not billions, of people. Rare complications will be more likely to show up once lots of people get the shot. And clinical trials of other Covid-19 vaccine candidates —like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine — have already been paused due to complications among recipients. For vaccinations, safety is paramount.

The Moderna vaccine has other important advantages

Monday’s vaccine efficacy announcement also illustrated some critical lessons about how Moderna was able to achieve these results and other details that could influence a vaccination strategy.

RNA is a viable way to make a vaccine: Moderna’s vaccine is now the second RNA-based vaccine that has demonstrated a high efficacy against Covid-19. Using RNA genetic material — in this case a variant known as mRNA — is a new vaccine technology. Such an approach has never received approval for widespread use, so these results are an important validation. The way it works is that the instructions for making a piece of the virus are inserted into the body. After cells read the instructions and manufacture the component of the virus, the immune system detects it and starts to mount a response.

This is a huge shift from conventional vaccines, which typically use a weakened version of the live virus, a whole dead virus, or a fragment of the virus. With RNA and similar DNA-based vaccines, there is no viral structure injected.

Like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, Moderna’s RNA-based vaccine also codes for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The spike is the part of the virus that lets it enter cells and take them over, and teaching the immune system to target this component has now been demonstrated to be a viable strategy.

Moderna’s vaccine appears to protect against mild and severe Covid-19: Efficacy in this context is defined as the share of vaccinated people who actually receive protection against the disease in question. For Covid-19, Food and Drug Administration guidelines say that a vaccine needs to provide protection against the coronavirus for at least 50 percent of the people who get it. That means at least half of the people who get the vaccine have to have some form of protection.

At 94.5 percent efficacy, Moderna’s results vault over this benchmark. But the company went a step further, reporting that out of the 11 severe Covid-19 cases it identified in its trial pool, all were in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group.

What this shows is that the vaccine is effective against severe manifestations of the illness. It may be the case that someone who gets vaccinated could still get a mild infection, but it’s likely the vaccine will keep them out of the hospital. While 11 is a small number of cases, it’s unlikely to have occurred by chance.

One lingering concern is that Moderna hasn’t disclosed how long this protection will last, and it may not be able to find out without simply waiting and seeing. Figuring out the duration of protection from a vaccine will likely require long-term monitoring.

Government support played a crucial role: Just about every vaccine candidate has benefited from the government’s efforts to speed up trials. The FDA allowed experimenters to run phases of clinical trials concurrently and accelerated many of their regulatory approval processes. The US government has also committed to buy millions of doses of a vaccine from whichever manufacturer crosses the line under Operation Warp Speed, a US government initiative aimed at procuring 300 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by January 2021.

That’s a big reason a Covid-19 vaccine may be on the market in record time, likely within two years instead of the typical decades-long development that vaccines usually require.

Moderna also received a direct boost under Operation Warp Speed. The Department of Health and Human Services awarded the company $483 million in April, followed by $472 million in July to support clinical trials. Then in August, HHS announced $1.5 billion in manufacturing support for Moderna’s vaccine.

It’s easier to keep Moderna’s vaccine cool than the one from Pfizer and BioNTech: Moderna was quick to highlight that its vaccine candidate has much lighter logistical requirements and can be stored at warmer temperatures than the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.

Moderna’s vaccine requires long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and is stable for 30 days between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s well within the temperature range of conventional refrigerators. Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, however, demands temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, which requires ultra-cold freezers and careful shipping.

That means the logistics of getting Moderna’s vaccine to people are much easier.

However, Moderna’s vaccine, like Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidates, is still a two-dose vaccine, which means every recipient will have to come back after several weeks for a second injection. And that means vaccinations will require twice the number of doses as a single-dose vaccine, adding to the cost of the effort.

What happens next for a Covid-19 vaccine

There are still several key steps between the results as they were announced, completing a trial, getting approval, and getting it to everyone that needs it.

The trial still has to run to completion, and both vaccine candidates — from Moderna and from Pfizer and BioNTech — need more safety data before they can seek full approval. However, they may be able to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. That would allow the vaccine to be used in limited cases for people facing some of the highest exposures to Covid-19, like health workers and workers in essential roles.

“Moderna intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with U.S. FDA in the coming weeks and expects the EUA to be based on the final analysis of 151 cases and a median follow-up of more than 2 months,” according to Moderna’s press release.

Related A vaccine may not be enough to end the pandemic

Once a vaccine gets approved, a global supply chain, from the glass vials that hold the vaccine to the syringes used to inject them, needs to spool up to make huge quantities of the vaccine. Manufacturers will also have to ensure that vaccines remain intact and under strict temperature controls from the factory to the hospitals and clinics where they will be used. The process of manufacturing, distributing, and administering a vaccine could take months.

And vaccine research doesn’t end once a vaccine gets approved. Researchers and companies will still have to track complications across millions of people and pay attention to how quickly immunity wanes.

It’s also important to remember that a vaccine is not enough on its own to end the pandemic. Measures like social distancing, good hygiene, and wearing face masks will remain essential to control the spread of Covid-19 until a vaccine is widely available. Public acceptance will also be a major issue, and health officials will have to overcome a rising wave of vaccine hesitancy.

A vaccine on its own will not end the #COVID19 pandemic. We will still need to continue:

While the end of the pandemic is now coming into focus with the latest vaccine announcements, a lot of hard work is still needed, and some of the toughest days of the Covid-19 pandemic lie ahead.

While the end of the pandemic is now coming into focus with the latest vaccine announcements, a lot of hard work is still needed, and some of the toughest days of the Covid-19 pandemic lie ahead.

Julia Belluz contributed reporting to this story.



Russian and North Korean Groups Still Targeting #COVID19 Vaccine FirmsMicrosoft points the finger at Fancy Bear, Lazarus and CeriumMicrosoft has urged governments to act after revealing that three state-sponsored threat groups have been targeting seven companies currently developing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

VP for customer security and trust, Tom Burt, pointed the finger at the Russian military Strontium group (aka APT28, Fancy Bear) and North Korea’s Zinc (aka Lazarus) and Cerium groups.

The pharma and vaccine companies being targeted were not named, but Microsoft said they hailed from Canada, France, India, South Korea and the US, and have vaccines and COVID-19 tests in clinical trials.

“Strontium continues to use password spray and brute force login attempts to steal login credentials. These are attacks that aim to break into people’s accounts using thousands or millions of rapid attempts,” Burt explained.

“Zinc has primarily used spear-phishing lures for credential theft, sending messages with fabricated job descriptions pretending to be recruiters. Cerium engaged in spear-phishing email lures using COVID-19 themes while masquerading as WHO representatives. The majority of these attacks were blocked by security protections built into our products. We’ve notified all organizations targeted, and where attacks have been successful, we’ve offered help.”

Such companies have been targeted throughout the year. Back in May reports suggested state-backed APT attacks on the UK’s leading vaccine contender, being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.

The same month, the US authorities blamed Chinese actors for trying to steal valuable virus research IP from domestic companies.

A couple of months later, Russia’s APT29 or Cozy Bear group were detected targeting vaccine developers in the UK, US and Canada in a campaign the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) branded “despicable.”

At the Paris Peace Forum on Friday, Microsoft’s Brad Smith urged governments to respond.

“Microsoft is calling on the world’s leaders to affirm that international law protects healthcare facilities and to take action to enforce the law,” said Burt.

“We believe the law should be enforced not just when attacks originate from government agencies but also when they originate from criminal groups that governments enable to operate – or even facilitate – within their borders. This is criminal activity that cannot be tolerated.”Russian and North Korean Groups Still Targeting #COVID19 Vaccine FirmsMicrosoft points the finger at Fancy Bear, Lazarus and CeriumMicrosoft has urged governments to act after revealing that three state-sponsored threat groups have been targeting seven companies currently developing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

Attacks on Pharma Rise Amid Targeting of #COVID19 Vaccine DevelopmentAttacks on pharma and biotech companies have grown by 50% this yearAttacks on the biotech and pharmaceutical industry have risen by 50% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to a new report from BlueVoyant.

These findings come amid positive recent news regarding the development of COVID-19 vaccines. It is unsurprising therefore that the cybersecurity firm found that eight of the most prominent companies working to create a vaccine for this virus have faced disproportionate levels of targeted malicious attacks in 2020 compared to other major pharma organizations.

Additionally, the researchers said the number one emerging threat this year is nation state espionage aimed at stealing COVID-19 vaccine research data, although the top threat overall in this sector remains ransomware.

In an analysis of open-source records of 25 publicly reported attacks during the past four years as well as research into 20 companies, including 12 of the largest biotech and pharma organizations in the world, BlueVoyant noted an escalating number of attacks. It observed that of the 25 attacks reported to the media since 2017, 10 (40%) occurred in 2020, while 80% of the 20 companies researched had experienced malicious, international and focused efforts this year.

Worryingly, most of the companies analyzed had not implemented important defenses against these types of attacks, such as securing open remote desktop access ports and phishing security.

Jim Penrose, COO, BlueVoyant, commented: “Pharmaceutical companies develop highly lucrative IP, they handle large amounts of patient and healthcare data and as such are a prime target for criminals looking to compromise, steal and exploit information. Now they face an even more elevated risk environment in the current pandemic as well-resourced nation state actors mount aggressive and focused campaigns.”

Jim Rosenthal, founder and CEO at BlueVoyant, added: “The ongoing effort to find a vaccine and cure for COVID-19 is an endeavor we all want to succeed. The high level of cyber-risk associated with the firms working on this critical mission ought to be a call for action to take immediate measures to drive down cyber-risk. Around the globe all citizens want peace of mind that these firms will guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability in their research, development, manufacturing and data management activities as they race against the clock to deliver life-saving breakthroughs.”

Earlier this week, it was reported that data breaches in the healthcare industry are expected to triple in volume in the coming year.Attacks on Pharma Rise Amid Targeting of #COVID19 Vaccine DevelopmentAttacks on pharma and biotech companies have grown by 50% this yearAttacks on the biotech and pharmaceutical industry have risen by 50% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to a new report from BlueVoyant.

Election Legitimacy

“Karl Rove: Trump lawsuits won’t change election’s outcome” [The HIll]. “Election analysts have said Biden’s margins are too large to make a material difference in several of the states in which Trump is mounting challenges. ‘There is no evidence of that so far,’ Rove wrote. ‘Unless some emerges quickly, the President’s chances in court will decline precipitously when states start certifying results.’ Rove, who served in former President George W. Bush’s administration and appears regularly as a political analyst on Fox News, said Trump and his team have a right to ensure every vote in the election was legally cast. [Rove called for] Trump to concede the election once all of his legal options have been exhausted.” • And Rove should know… PA: “Pennsylvania Court Tosses Some Mail-In Ballots With ID Fixes” [Bloomberg]. “Pennsylvania mail-in voters who took advantage of a deadline extension to provide missing proof of identification won’t have their ballots counted in the final tally. Commonwealth Court Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt ruled Thursday that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar lacked the authority to extend the original Nov. 9 deadline for proof of ID by 3 days. The ruling means the battleground state that’s already been declared for President-elect Joe Biden can’t count ballots from voters who submitted missing identification between Nov. 10 and Nov. 12. Ballots with “cured” ID issues received before that aren’t being challenged…. It’s not clear how many ballots fit that bill, though state officials have said suits over defective ballots can’t change the outcome of the race, in which Biden had a lead on Thursday of 55,978 votes.” “No, Dominion voting machines did not delete Trump votes.” [New York Times]. • if one of the outcomes of the 2020 election is legitimating (private equity-made, unauditable) ballot marking devices, I’m gonna cut the soles of my shoes, sit up in a tree, and learn to play the flute. “REPORT: Dominion Voting Systems Didn’t Cause Voter Fraud In Michigan Or Georgia” [Daily Caller]. ”

Some committee members were frustrated the party didn’t do more to address “the elephant in the room” after briefly touching on the independent investigation released last week re: Alex Morse’s campaign pic.twitter.com/6GzAp5uoVQ — Stephanie Murray (@stephanie_murr) November 13, 2020 “Elissa Slotkin Braces for a Democratic Civil War” [Politico]. Slotkin should know; she’s a CIA Democrat. “She fears that Democrats have created a barrier to entry, largely along cultural lines, that makes the party fundamentally unwelcoming to anyone with supposedly retrograde views of the world around them. This is not merely about race and racism. The schisms go far deeper, to matters of faith and conscience, economic freedom and individual liberty. Indeed, for the heavy losses Trump sustained among affluent college-educated whites, he nearly won a second term because of his gains with Black and brown voters. That these Americans were willing to support Trump, often in spite of his rhetoric, reveals an uncomfortable truth for the left.” • I can’t think of another publication that more relentlessly confuses liberals and left than Politico. And I’m noticing CIA Democrats all over my Twitter feed lately. Odd. “Joe Biden’s Likely Pick to Lead His Party” [The Atlantic]. Wait, let me guess. A loser. Yep: “there’s only one name on leading Democrats’ list for Democratic National Committee chair: Jaime Harrison, who lost a race for U.S. Senate in South Carolina last week…. Harrison became nationally known this year during his run against Senator Lindsey Graham, as he set fundraising records and became a cause for Democrats far beyond his state. Graham ultimately won by a much-wider-than-expected 10-point margin… Harrison has the support of James Clyburn….” • And he’s not just a loser, he’s worked for the Podesta Group: “His clients at the Podesta Group included banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, Berkshire Hathaway, pharmaceutical companies, casinos, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, and Walmart.” He’s perfect!

Biden Transition

“One Third of Biden’s Pentagon Transition Team Hails From Organizations Financed by the Weapons Industry” [In These Times]. “Of the 23 peo­ple who com­prise the Depart­ment of Defense agency review team, eight of them — or just over a third — list their ​”most recent employ­ment” as orga­ni­za­tions, think tanks or com­pa­nies that either direct­ly receive mon­ey from the weapons indus­try, or are part of this indus­try.” • Shocker! UPDATE “Biden chooses a White House chief who ‘matches this moment'” [The Hill]. “Though Klain has advised many of the Democratic Party’s senior leaders, he has always been close to Biden, beginning in 1988 when he worked as a speechwriter on Biden’s first presidential campaign… He has served as a chief of staff to former Vice President Al Gore, then as the chief counsel leading Gore’s legal strategy during the 2000 recount…. As the economy cratered during the transition between administrations, Obama delegated the implementation of the recovery package to his vice president and to Klain.” • Wait. Wait. The 1988 Biden campaign was the one where Biden plagiarized a speech, and Gore’s legal strategy in the Florida 2000 recount was a debacle, as was Obama’s recovery program. So hold onto your hats. To be fair, this: [Klain rejoined the administration] manage the American response to the worst outbreak of the Ebola virus in modern history in three impoverished West African countries. Klain had no experience managing a public health crisis or with the Ebola virus. But he was an expert in the machinations of a leviathan government, and how to work its levers to speed implementation of White House decisions that needed to be executed immediately. For six months, Klain and his small team worked out of a prime office suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building overlooking the White House. He managed sometimes warring factions of America’s crisis management infrastructure, from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to help bring the virus under control overseas and to prepare the nation’s hospitals for a domestic outbreak that never materialized. I had thought Klain had some public health expertise, but no; he’s a fixer. (This is also the liberal Democrat concept of “leadership”: working the levels. “Fundamentally, nothing will change.”) I’m not sure if experience managing Ebola translates to experience managing Covid; perhaps some of epidemiologists can comment.

2020

Trump (R)(1): “Why Trump’s Suburban Strategy Failed” [Bloomberg]. “While the majority of White women voted for Trump in 2020, even more so than in 2016, pre-election polling suggested that suburban women were likely to be among his largest defectors. There are likely a number of a reasons for this, but one of them is that Trump’s strategy fundamentally misunderstood the suburbanites he was talking to. Many White suburbanites already had Black and brown neighbors that Trump told them to fear, shared similar concerns around the lives lost to Covid-19, and had protests over anti-Black police violence happening right outside their doorsteps. Many were unconvinced that low-income housing would result in crime or falling property values and supported racially integrated neighborhoods. In the battleground suburbs of Minneapolis and Wisconsin, polls showed that White women were not particularly concerned about affordable housing in their backyards. In the Philadelphia suburbs, Trump’s rhetoric on race galvanized White suburban women to organize against him. In Portland, White suburban moms and dads came out with leaf blowers to keep police from attacking Black and brown protesters.” * * * “Why pollsters missed the election results so badly” [The National Journal]. “Of all the embarrassing polling misses in the 2020 election, the biggest disconnect between polling and reality came from the House-race landscape. The consensus among the top electoral handicappers was that Republicans would lose 10-15 House seats, with all the late movement benefiting Democrats. Instead, Republicans are on track to net at least seven House seats, and may end up winning as many as 13 Democratic-held seats when all the votes are counted. It’s likely that not a single House Republican will lose reelection. That’s a whopping error that can’t be dismissed lightly…. While polling from partisans can certainly be cherry-picked to push a favorable narrative, there was a remarkable degree of consensus between what Republican and Democratic congressional campaign operatives were seeing this year. Their major takeaway: Republicans were going to get wiped out in the suburbs, particularly in affluent, conservative-leaning Southern and Midwestern districts that had long been Republican strongholds…. the House results give credence to an alternative view, outlined in a compelling article by political science professor Eric Kaufmann, arguing that “political correctness has left a cadre of white college graduates unwilling to reveal their voting intentions.” In the piece, he offers evidence that there is a shy Trump vote coming not from white working-class MAGA supporters but rather from affluent Republican-leaning voters in the suburbs afraid to share their views on politics and hot-button cultural issues in public.” • Predatory precarity! UPDATE “How Did Trump Do in Counties That Backed Him in 2016?” [New York Times]. One of those horrid interactive things the Times does more and more, but still useful: “But a vast majority of the counties that swung hard for Mr. Trump in 2016 continued to firmly support him this year, or shifted even further to the right.” UPDATE “Democrats Can’t Blame the Left for Their Lackluster Election Results” [Jacobin]. “Had Democrats delivered the landslide many were promising right up until election day, it’s not difficult to imagine the conclusions that would have ensued. Having defeated Bernie Sanders’s insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination and run the pathologically centrist Biden in his place, centrists would have viewed the result as ultimate proof of the Left’s irrelevance. We all know, of course, that the election yielded nothing of the kind…. As both Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have argued, no fewer than a hundred twelve House cosponsors of Medicare for All stood for election and not a single one lost (at least eight Democratic House members who ran against Medicare for All, meanwhile, were defeated). Of the Green New Deal’s ninety-three cosponsors, ninety-two will be returning to Congress in January. As Ben Burgis points out, left-wing organizing work in states like Michigan also played a significant role in ensuring Biden’s victory at the top of the ballot.” UPDATE “LatinX-plaining the election” [The Pull Request]. “One day, it suddenly seemed like every upper-middle-class LatAm family had a bank account and a condo in Miami, and was sending their kids to FIU (the local state university, highest foreign enrollment in the US). Miami had gone from a provincial city of refuge to a cross between Vancouver and Singapore, but for Latin America instead of China… Which is why I was unsurprised with the election news about how Miami Cubans had broken ever harder right than usual, helping secure Florida for Trump. It’s exactly what I would have expected… The other ‘Latino’ shock of the election was the Texas border counties that flipped or otherwise showed huge GOP gains, sometimes more than 30%(!), in counties that are heavily (meaning close to 90%) Hispanic…. Firstly, concerns about the energy economy in the area drove much voting: Biden’s comments about eventually shuttering the oil industry in the debate did not go over well. And after that, the usual laundry list of typical political concerns, little distinguishable from other GOP voters: jobs, gun rights, jobs, abortion, jobs, religion, and once again, jobs. What most stuck out due to its absence in all these “why’d these counties go red?” pieces is the overarching issue that supposedly obsesses the Hispanic voter: immigration…. Only from the all-look-same perspective of the Anglo mainstream would American Hispanics, many of whom have been here for generations, somehow reflexively consider themselves in the same boat as undocumented migrants coming across the border.” • The whole piece is worth a read. * * * AK: “Sullivan wins re-election in Alaska, taking U.S. Senate battle down to Georgia” [Reuters]. “U.S. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska won re-election, Edison Research and television networks projected on Wednesday, leaving control of the Senate to be determined in January by two runoff elections in Georgia.” UPDATE AL “In the Weeds w/ Tommy Tuberville, Alabama’s next senator” [Alabama Daily News]. Tuberville: “[M]y dad fought 76 years ago in Europe to free Europe of Socialism.” • The whole interview is worth a read. Tuberville is being pilloried as an idiot, but his comments on staffing decisions are interesting. “[L]earn the fundamentals!” Here’s Tuberbville’s coaching record. “He is the only coach in Auburn football history to beat in-state rival Alabama six consecutive times.” So he’s got that going for him. UPDATE CA: “And the winner is … real estate: Cali’s industry cleaned up on Election Day” [The Real Deal]. “After a year struggling to collect rent, show homes and get loans, the California real estate industry won big on Election Day. Voters defeated a ballot initiative that would have let cities and counties impose residential rent control. The margin of victory, 60 percent to 40 percent with nearly three-quarters of ballots counted as of noon Thursday, was decisive. Another measure, which sought to raise commercial property taxes, seemed headed for defeat with ‘no’ votes leading ‘yes’ 51.7 percent to 48.3 percent. And a ballot question financed by the California Association of Realtors to encourage home sales looks likely to pass. The current tally on Proposition 19 is 51.5 percent ‘yes’ and 48.5 percent ‘no.'” UPDATE KY: “Hal Rogers’s Kentucky Kingdom” [Tarance Ray, Dissent]. “[A]s a former Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the elite “College of Cardinals” that manages the government’s budget, and the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, [Rogers is] one of the most powerful men in Washington…. Most people, when they think of powerful politicians from Kentucky, think of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who over the last decade or so has singlehandedly reshaped how Congress functions, and has all but ensured the prioritization of corporate interests within the federal judiciary. So you’re telling me there’s another powerful congressman from Kentucky who has control over virtually every aspect of my life? That is indeed what I’m telling you, my friend, and it’s no coincidence that both of these men come from the mostly rural state of Kentucky…. As the nation’s rural regions experienced deindustrialization, out-migration, drug-assisted suicide, or a combination of all the above over the last three or four decades, rural elites had to figure out a way to maintain control over their constituents. Many of them turned to Rogers’s example.” • This is must read; I can’t really excerpt it properly, it’s so dense.

RussiaGate

“What is John Brennan So Worried About?” [Ray McGovern, Consortium News]. “Brennan appeared this week on both CNN and MSNBC to spread alarm about what Trump might do as he continues to contest the election results and appoints new people at Defense, NSA (and possibly CIA) who may do his bidding. Brennan warned on CNN that it was ‘very, very worrisome’ that Trump ‘is just very unpredictable now … like a cornered cat — tiger. And he’s going to lash out.’ Brennan told MSNBC he was worried that Trump has called for the ‘wholesale declassification of intelligence in order to further his own political interests.'” • You say “wholesale declassification of intelligence” like that’s a bad thing.

Realignment and Legitimacy

UPDATE “Young Democratic Socialist, progressive candidates sweep into office across Peninsula” [Mercury News]. “All across the Bay, socialist and progressive young people like Lopez led insurgent campaigns for local elected positions and won, including several against sitting council members and established community leaders that led to upsets. From Redwood City to Oakland to South San Francisco, grassroots campaigns brought together tenant activist groups, unions and local community movements and elected firmly left-wing candidates who promised to bring socialist and progressive ideas to city councils that have fallen out of favor with many low-income people facing difficult material realities in increasingly more gentrified communities…. The local South Bay [DSA] chapter …. — which boasts nearly 100,000 members — endorsed six candidates, with just two losing out.” “Culture and Belonging in the USA” [Political Research Associates]. “Coming onto the scene in 2016, Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys are part of a trend of Far Right organizing that departs from their explicitly White nationalist contemporaries, and often fuses antiracist language into otherwise nationalist, misogynistic, libertarian, and xenophobic platforms. With people of color in positions of leadership and representing 10 percent9 of their August rally, the groups represent something substantively different from old-style White supremacism in terms of both ideology and organizing: what scholars and journalists refer to as the Multiracial Far Right. The emergence of this new bloc raises several questions. First, why are people of multiracial backgrounds gravitating to Far Right groups? Further, is this a new phenomenon or is there historical precedent for this sort of unlikely partnership? Finally, if racial exclusion isn’t the ultimate glue that binds this sector of Far Right groups together, how are these groups “transcending” race, and what issues continue to be fault lines within their movement?” UPDATE “The Next Decade Could Be Even Worse” [The Atlantic]. “The year 2020 has been kind to Turchin, for many of the same reasons it has been hell for the rest of us. Cities on fire, elected leaders endorsing violence, homicides surging—­­to a normal American, these are apocalyptic signs. To Turchin, they indicate that his models, which incorporate thousands of years of data about human history, are working. (“Not all of human history,” he corrected me once. “Just the last 10,000 years.”) He has been warning for a decade that a few key social and political trends portend an “age of discord,” civil unrest and carnage worse than most Americans have experienced. In 2010, he predicted that the unrest would get serious around 2020, and that it wouldn’t let up until those social and political trends reversed. Havoc at the level of the late 1960s and early ’70s is the best-case scenario; all-out civil war is the worst. The fundamental problems, he says, are a dark triad of social maladies: a bloated elite class, with too few elite jobs to go around; declining living standards among the general population; and a government that can’t cover its financial positions.” • Interesting read. I’m not sure how good Turchin’s data really is; in fact, the whole concept of representing history as fielded data strikes me as odd. Mike Duncan comments: We are probably at the nadir of "General Laws of History" being anything any historian believes, pursues, or advocates. So I don't mind Turchin's attempt. If only to voice something that nobody wants to voice anymore. — Mike Duncan (@mikeduncan) November 13, 2020

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

Consumer Sentiment: “Preliminary November 2020 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Significantly Declines Due To Republican Consumers” [Econintersect]. “Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, makes the following comments: ‘Consumer sentiment fell in early November as consumers judged future economic prospects less favorably, while their assessments of current economic conditions remained largely unchanged. The outcome of the presidential election as well as the resurgence in covid infections and deaths were responsible for the early November decline. Interviews conducted following the election recorded a substantial negative shift in the Expectations Index among Republicans, but recorded no gain among Democrats. It is likely that Democrats’ fears about the covid resurgence offset gains in economic expectations: 59% of Democrats reported that their normal life had changed to a great extent due to the coronavirus compared with just 34% among Republicans. The gap in expectations closed somewhat due to the coronavirus and the partisan shift in expectations that began well before the election. Note that Republicans now voice the least favorable economic expectations since Trump took office, and Democrats have voiced more positive expectations….

The issues seemed to begin close to the time when Apple began rolling out the new version of macOS, Big Sur—but it affected users of other versions of macOS, like Catalina and Mojave… It didn’t take long for some Mac users to note that trustd—a macOS process responsible for checking with Apple’s servers to confirm that an app is notarized—was attempting to contact a host named ocsp.apple.com but failing repeatedly.

Mr. Market: “Pfizer vaccine news sparks $44.5 billion flood into the stock market—its biggest weekly inflow ever, says BofA” [MarketWatch]. ” How seismic was the stock-market move that kicked off the week following news of effective coronavirus vaccine candidate? It was the best week ever for inflows, according to BofA Global Research, in a report dated Thursday but released broadly on Friday. The investment management firm reported some $44.5 billion in flows into equity funds for the week, exceeding a flood of funds that poured into stocks back near the spring of 2018. About $38.7 billion of investor funds were pumped into exchange-traded funds, while $5.7 billion flowed into mutual funds. Investors also reduced their cash holdings by $17.8 billion, according to the report led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist. Meanwhile, the analysts noted that flows into government bonds yielding less than 0% surged to around $17 trillion, approaching the highest since late 2019.” • $17 trillion! That’s real money!

“‘Breakthrough Finding’ Reveals Why Certain COVID Patients Die” [Kaiser Health News]. “In an international study in Science, 10% of nearly 1,000 COVID patients who developed life-threatening pneumonia had antibodies that disable key immune system proteins called interferons. These antibodies — known as autoantibodies because they attack the body itself — were not found at all in 663 people with mild or asymptomatic COVID infections . Only four of 1,227 healthy individuals had the autoantibodies. The study, published on Oct. 23, was led by the COVID Human Genetic Effort, which includes 200 research centers in 40 countries. Significantly, patients didn’t make autoantibodies in response to the virus. Instead, they appeared to have had them before the pandemic even began , said Paul Bastard, the antibody study’s lead author, also a researcher at Rockefeller University. For reasons that researchers don’t understand, the autoantibodies never caused a problem until patients were infected with COVID-19, Bastard said. Somehow, the novel coronavirus, or the immune response it triggered, appears to have set them in motion. ‘Before COVID, their condition was silent,’ Bastard said. “Most of them hadn’t gotten sick before.”

“Fewer people say they would take a COVID-19 vaccine now than 3 months ago” [World Economic Forum]. “But this latest World Economic Forum-Ipsos survey shows that confidence in taking a COVID-19 vaccine has dropped since August, with fewer people globally saying they’d get one. The survey shows that on average, across 15 countries, 73% of adults strongly or somewhat agree with the statement “if a vaccine for COVID-19 were available, I would get it”. 3 months ago, that figure was 77%. At the time, the shortfall in vaccine confidence was significant enough to be seen to compromise the effectiveness of seeing an end to the pandemic. Confidence is now down by 4 points compared to three months ago. Vaccination intent has declined in 10 of the 15 countries, most of all China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil. More than four in five in India, mainland China, South Korea, and Brazil, however, say they would get a vaccine if available – compared to just over half in France and about two in three in the US, Spain, Italy, South Africa, Japan, and Germany.”

“Poorer nations face vaccine wait as West locks down supply” [Agence France Presse]. “Hailed this week as a pandemic game-changer, the new Covid-19 vaccine offered countries that had pre-ordered doses a potential escape from a cycle of lockdowns and new waves of sickness and death. But while richer nations plan their vaccination programmes through the end of 2021, experts warn that poorer and developing countries face hurdles that could deny billions the first proven protection against the coronavirus. Vaccine developers Pfizer and BioNTech plan to roll out the first doses within weeks, once they receive emergency use permissions from drug agencies. They expect to have 1.3 billion doses ready next year. The results of phase 3 clinical trials showed their mRNA vaccine was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 symptoms and did not produce adverse side effects among thousands of volunteers.” • They didn’t effing “show it.” A press release asserted it. We haven’t seen any data.

“Pathfinder: Alabama health officer Dr. Scott Harris on a mission to guide state through COVID crisis” [Montgomery Advertiser]. “[W]ith new COVID-19 cases surging nationwide, [Dr. Scott Harris] would stand in his usual spot beside the governor as she announces that Alabama is extending its statewide mask order into December. It would remain the only state among its southeastern neighbors with such a mandate, a fact that has been widely shared with disdain and anger by anti-maskers. Ivey would also announce that the state is relaxing occupancy restrictions on businesses where masks, distancing and other sanitation rules can be maintained. More than 1,000 comments would flood the livestream of the announcement on Ivey’s official Facebook page — rage, insults, debunked misinformation, even warnings of violence. Death threats throughout the pandemic have forced Harris, a grandfather from Talladega who grew up admiring his small-town family doctor, to wear a bulletproof vest at some public appearances.”

“Stanford vs. Harvard: Two Famous Biz Schools’ Opposing Tactics on COVID” [Kaiser Health News]. “But the guts of [Harvard’s] instructions were similar to those at Stanford. Both Harvard and Stanford severely restricted who could be on campus at any given time, limiting access to students, staff members and preapproved visitors. Both required that anyone living on campus report their health daily through an online portal, checking for any symptoms that could be caused by COVID-19. Both required face coverings when outside on campus — even, a Harvard missive said, in situations ‘when physical distancing from others can be maintained.'” • Not sure how representative the Harvard and Stanford business school student bodies are, however…

They see dirty cities, lousy infrastructure, and the political clown show on TV, and an insular people clinging to their guns and their gods who boast about how they are the greatest people in the world without knowing anything about what is going on outside. They come back and tell me: ‘We have nothing to learn from those people! Why did you send me there?'” Malik: “There is no shame in admitting that we are in need of self-improvement. We must begin by addressing the horror of this year, which has exposed a range of problems. I am confident that long-term and even permanent solutions to many of these problems exist. We can and will be better. Maybe it is my day job, or perhaps it is the delusion of an immigrant’s mind, but I believe the tradition of dreaming up something from nothing is still alive in this country.

Election Legitimacy

“Karl Rove: Trump lawsuits won’t change election’s outcome” [The HIll]. “Election analysts have said Biden’s margins are too large to make a material difference in several of the states in which Trump is mounting challenges. ‘There is no evidence of that so far,’ Rove wrote. ‘Unless some emerges quickly, the President’s chances in court will decline precipitously when states start certifying results.’ Rove, who served in former President George W. Bush’s administration and appears regularly as a political analyst on Fox News, said Trump and his team have a right to ensure every vote in the election was legally cast. [Rove called for] Trump to concede the election once all of his legal options have been exhausted.” • And Rove should know… PA: “Pennsylvania Court Tosses Some Mail-In Ballots With ID Fixes” [Bloomberg]. “Pennsylvania mail-in voters who took advantage of a deadline extension to provide missing proof of identification won’t have their ballots counted in the final tally. Commonwealth Court Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt ruled Thursday that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar lacked the authority to extend the original Nov. 9 deadline for proof of ID by 3 days. The ruling means the battleground state that’s already been declared for President-elect Joe Biden can’t count ballots from voters who submitted missing identification between Nov. 10 and Nov. 12. Ballots with “cured” ID issues received before that aren’t being challenged…. It’s not clear how many ballots fit that bill, though state officials have said suits over defective ballots can’t change the outcome of the race, in which Biden had a lead on Thursday of 55,978 votes.” “No, Dominion voting machines did not delete Trump votes.” [New York Times]. • if one of the outcomes of the 2020 election is legitimating (private equity-made, unauditable) ballot marking devices, I’m gonna cut the soles of my shoes, sit up in a tree, and learn to play the flute. “REPORT: Dominion Voting Systems Didn’t Cause Voter Fraud In Michigan Or Georgia” [Daily Caller]. ”

Slotkin should know; she’s a CIA Democrat. “She fears that Democrats have created a barrier to entry, largely along cultural lines, that makes the party fundamentally unwelcoming to anyone with supposedly retrograde views of the world around them. This is not merely about race and racism. The schisms go far deeper, to matters of faith and conscience, economic freedom and individual liberty. Indeed, for the heavy losses Trump sustained among affluent college-educated whites, he nearly won a second term because of his gains with Black and brown voters. That these Americans were willing to support Trump, often in spite of his rhetoric, reveals an uncomfortable truth for the left.” • I can’t think of another publication that more relentlessly confuses liberals and left than Politico. And I’m noticing CIA Democrats all over my Twitter feed lately. Odd. “Joe Biden’s Likely Pick to Lead His Party” [The Atlantic]. Wait, let me guess. A loser. Yep: “there’s only one name on leading Democrats’ list for Democratic National Committee chair: Jaime Harrison, who lost a race for U.S. Senate in South Carolina last week…. Harrison became nationally known this year during his run against Senator Lindsey Graham, as he set fundraising records and became a cause for Democrats far beyond his state. Graham ultimately won by a much-wider-than-expected 10-point margin… Harrison has the support of James Clyburn….” • And he’s not just a loser, he’s worked for the Podesta Group: “His clients at the Podesta Group included banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, Berkshire Hathaway, pharmaceutical companies, casinos, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, and Walmart.” He’s perfect!

Biden Transition

“One Third of Biden’s Pentagon Transition Team Hails From Organizations Financed by the Weapons Industry” [In These Times]. “Of the 23 peo­ple who com­prise the Depart­ment of Defense agency review team, eight of them — or just over a third — list their ​”most recent employ­ment” as orga­ni­za­tions, think tanks or com­pa­nies that either direct­ly receive mon­ey from the weapons indus­try, or are part of this indus­try.” • Shocker! UPDATE “Biden chooses a White House chief who ‘matches this moment'” [The Hill]. “Though Klain has advised many of the Democratic Party’s senior leaders, he has always been close to Biden, beginning in 1988 when he worked as a speechwriter on Biden’s first presidential campaign… He has served as a chief of staff to former Vice President Al Gore, then as the chief counsel leading Gore’s legal strategy during the 2000 recount…. As the economy cratered during the transition between administrations, Obama delegated the implementation of the recovery package to his vice president and to Klain.” • Wait. Wait. The 1988 Biden campaign was the one where Biden plagiarized a speech, and Gore’s legal strategy in the Florida 2000 recount was a debacle, as was Obama’s recovery program. So hold onto your hats. To be fair, this: [Klain rejoined the administration] manage the American response to the worst outbreak of the Ebola virus in modern history in three impoverished West African countries. Klain had no experience managing a public health crisis or with the Ebola virus. But he was an expert in the machinations of a leviathan government, and how to work its levers to speed implementation of White House decisions that needed to be executed immediately. For six months, Klain and his small team worked out of a prime office suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building overlooking the White House. He managed sometimes warring factions of America’s crisis management infrastructure, from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to help bring the virus under control overseas and to prepare the nation’s hospitals for a domestic outbreak that never materialized. I had thought Klain had some public health expertise, but no; he’s a fixer. (This is also the liberal Democrat concept of “leadership”: working the levels. “Fundamentally, nothing will change.”) I’m not sure if experience managing Ebola translates to experience managing Covid; perhaps some of epidemiologists can comment.

2020

Trump (R)(1): “Why Trump’s Suburban Strategy Failed” [Bloomberg]. “While the majority of White women voted for Trump in 2020, even more so than in 2016, pre-election polling suggested that suburban women were likely to be among his largest defectors. There are likely a number of a reasons for this, but one of them is that Trump’s strategy fundamentally misunderstood the suburbanites he was talking to. Many White suburbanites already had Black and brown neighbors that Trump told them to fear, shared similar concerns around the lives lost to Covid-19, and had protests over anti-Black police violence happening right outside their doorsteps. Many were unconvinced that low-income housing would result in crime or falling property values and supported racially integrated neighborhoods. In the battleground suburbs of Minneapolis and Wisconsin, polls showed that White women were not particularly concerned about affordable housing in their backyards. In the Philadelphia suburbs, Trump’s rhetoric on race galvanized White suburban women to organize against him. In Portland, White suburban moms and dads came out with leaf blowers to keep police from attacking Black and brown protesters.” * * * “Why pollsters missed the election results so badly” [The National Journal]. “Of all the embarrassing polling misses in the 2020 election, the biggest disconnect between polling and reality came from the House-race landscape. The consensus among the top electoral handicappers was that Republicans would lose 10-15 House seats, with all the late movement benefiting Democrats. Instead, Republicans are on track to net at least seven House seats, and may end up winning as many as 13 Democratic-held seats when all the votes are counted. It’s likely that not a single House Republican will lose reelection. That’s a whopping error that can’t be dismissed lightly…. While polling from partisans can certainly be cherry-picked to push a favorable narrative, there was a remarkable degree of consensus between what Republican and Democratic congressional campaign operatives were seeing this year. Their major takeaway: Republicans were going to get wiped out in the suburbs, particularly in affluent, conservative-leaning Southern and Midwestern districts that had long been Republican strongholds…. the House results give credence to an alternative view, outlined in a compelling article by political science professor Eric Kaufmann, arguing that “political correctness has left a cadre of white college graduates unwilling to reveal their voting intentions.” In the piece, he offers evidence that there is a shy Trump vote coming not from white working-class MAGA supporters but rather from affluent Republican-leaning voters in the suburbs afraid to share their views on politics and hot-button cultural issues in public.” • Predatory precarity! UPDATE “How Did Trump Do in Counties That Backed Him in 2016?” [New York Times]. One of those horrid interactive things the Times does more and more, but still useful: “But a vast majority of the counties that swung hard for Mr. Trump in 2016 continued to firmly support him this year, or shifted even further to the right.” UPDATE “Democrats Can’t Blame the Left for Their Lackluster Election Results” [Jacobin]. “Had Democrats delivered the landslide many were promising right up until election day, it’s not difficult to imagine the conclusions that would have ensued. Having defeated Bernie Sanders’s insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination and run the pathologically centrist Biden in his place, centrists would have viewed the result as ultimate proof of the Left’s irrelevance. We all know, of course, that the election yielded nothing of the kind…. As both Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have argued, no fewer than a hundred twelve House cosponsors of Medicare for All stood for election and not a single one lost (at least eight Democratic House members who ran against Medicare for All, meanwhile, were defeated). Of the Green New Deal’s ninety-three cosponsors, ninety-two will be returning to Congress in January. As Ben Burgis points out, left-wing organizing work in states like Michigan also played a significant role in ensuring Biden’s victory at the top of the ballot.” UPDATE “LatinX-plaining the election” [The Pull Request]. “One day, it suddenly seemed like every upper-middle-class LatAm family had a bank account and a condo in Miami, and was sending their kids to FIU (the local state university, highest foreign enrollment in the US). Miami had gone from a provincial city of refuge to a cross between Vancouver and Singapore, but for Latin America instead of China… Which is why I was unsurprised with the election news about how Miami Cubans had broken ever harder right than usual, helping secure Florida for Trump. It’s exactly what I would have expected… The other ‘Latino’ shock of the election was the Texas border counties that flipped or otherwise showed huge GOP gains, sometimes more than 30%(!), in counties that are heavily (meaning close to 90%) Hispanic…. Firstly, concerns about the energy economy in the area drove much voting: Biden’s comments about eventually shuttering the oil industry in the debate did not go over well. And after that, the usual laundry list of typical political concerns, little distinguishable from other GOP voters: jobs, gun rights, jobs, abortion, jobs, religion, and once again, jobs. What most stuck out due to its absence in all these “why’d these counties go red?” pieces is the overarching issue that supposedly obsesses the Hispanic voter: immigration…. Only from the all-look-same perspective of the Anglo mainstream would American Hispanics, many of whom have been here for generations, somehow reflexively consider themselves in the same boat as undocumented migrants coming across the border.” • The whole piece is worth a read. * * * AK: “Sullivan wins re-election in Alaska, taking U.S. Senate battle down to Georgia” [Reuters]. “U.S. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska won re-election, Edison Research and television networks projected on Wednesday, leaving control of the Senate to be determined in January by two runoff elections in Georgia.” UPDATE AL “In the Weeds w/ Tommy Tuberville, Alabama’s next senator” [Alabama Daily News]. Tuberville: “[M]y dad fought 76 years ago in Europe to free Europe of Socialism.” • The whole interview is worth a read. Tuberville is being pilloried as an idiot, but his comments on staffing decisions are interesting. “[L]earn the fundamentals!” Here’s Tuberbville’s coaching record. “He is the only coach in Auburn football history to beat in-state rival Alabama six consecutive times.” So he’s got that going for him. UPDATE CA: “And the winner is … real estate: Cali’s industry cleaned up on Election Day” [The Real Deal]. “After a year struggling to collect rent, show homes and get loans, the California real estate industry won big on Election Day. Voters defeated a ballot initiative that would have let cities and counties impose residential rent control. The margin of victory, 60 percent to 40 percent with nearly three-quarters of ballots counted as of noon Thursday, was decisive. Another measure, which sought to raise commercial property taxes, seemed headed for defeat with ‘no’ votes leading ‘yes’ 51.7 percent to 48.3 percent. And a ballot question financed by the California Association of Realtors to encourage home sales looks likely to pass. The current tally on Proposition 19 is 51.5 percent ‘yes’ and 48.5 percent ‘no.'” UPDATE KY: “Hal Rogers’s Kentucky Kingdom” [Tarance Ray, Dissent]. “[A]s a former Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the elite “College of Cardinals” that manages the government’s budget, and the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, [Rogers is] one of the most powerful men in Washington…. Most people, when they think of powerful politicians from Kentucky, think of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who over the last decade or so has singlehandedly reshaped how Congress functions, and has all but ensured the prioritization of corporate interests within the federal judiciary. So you’re telling me there’s another powerful congressman from Kentucky who has control over virtually every aspect of my life? That is indeed what I’m telling you, my friend, and it’s no coincidence that both of these men come from the mostly rural state of Kentucky…. As the nation’s rural regions experienced deindustrialization, out-migration, drug-assisted suicide, or a combination of all the above over the last three or four decades, rural elites had to figure out a way to maintain control over their constituents. Many of them turned to Rogers’s example.” • This is must read; I can’t really excerpt it properly, it’s so dense.

RussiaGate

“What is John Brennan So Worried About?” [Ray McGovern, Consortium News]. “Brennan appeared this week on both CNN and MSNBC to spread alarm about what Trump might do as he continues to contest the election results and appoints new people at Defense, NSA (and possibly CIA) who may do his bidding. Brennan warned on CNN that it was ‘very, very worrisome’ that Trump ‘is just very unpredictable now … like a cornered cat — tiger. And he’s going to lash out.’ Brennan told MSNBC he was worried that Trump has called for the ‘wholesale declassification of intelligence in order to further his own political interests.'” • You say “wholesale declassification of intelligence” like that’s a bad thing.

Realignment and Legitimacy

UPDATE “Young Democratic Socialist, progressive candidates sweep into office across Peninsula” [Mercury News]. “All across the Bay, socialist and progressive young people like Lopez led insurgent campaigns for local elected positions and won, including several against sitting council members and established community leaders that led to upsets. From Redwood City to Oakland to South San Francisco, grassroots campaigns brought together tenant activist groups, unions and local community movements and elected firmly left-wing candidates who promised to bring socialist and progressive ideas to city councils that have fallen out of favor with many low-income people facing difficult material realities in increasingly more gentrified communities…. The local South Bay [DSA] chapter …. — which boasts nearly 100,000 members — endorsed six candidates, with just two losing out.” “Culture and Belonging in the USA” [Political Research Associates]. “Coming onto the scene in 2016, Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys are part of a trend of Far Right organizing that departs from their explicitly White nationalist contemporaries, and often fuses antiracist language into otherwise nationalist, misogynistic, libertarian, and xenophobic platforms. With people of color in positions of leadership and representing 10 percent9 of their August rally, the groups represent something substantively different from old-style White supremacism in terms of both ideology and organizing: what scholars and journalists refer to as the Multiracial Far Right. The emergence of this new bloc raises several questions. First, why are people of multiracial backgrounds gravitating to Far Right groups? Further, is this a new phenomenon or is there historical precedent for this sort of unlikely partnership? Finally, if racial exclusion isn’t the ultimate glue that binds this sector of Far Right groups together, how are these groups “transcending” race, and what issues continue to be fault lines within their movement?” UPDATE “The Next Decade Could Be Even Worse” [The Atlantic]. “The year 2020 has been kind to Turchin, for many of the same reasons it has been hell for the rest of us. Cities on fire, elected leaders endorsing violence, homicides surging—­­to a normal American, these are apocalyptic signs. To Turchin, they indicate that his models, which incorporate thousands of years of data about human history, are working. (“Not all of human history,” he corrected me once. “Just the last 10,000 years.”) He has been warning for a decade that a few key social and political trends portend an “age of discord,” civil unrest and carnage worse than most Americans have experienced. In 2010, he predicted that the unrest would get serious around 2020, and that it wouldn’t let up until those social and political trends reversed. Havoc at the level of the late 1960s and early ’70s is the best-case scenario; all-out civil war is the worst. The fundamental problems, he says, are a dark triad of social maladies: a bloated elite class, with too few elite jobs to go around; declining living standards among the general population; and a government that can’t cover its financial positions.” • Interesting read. I’m not sure how good Turchin’s data really is; in fact, the whole concept of representing history as fielded data strikes me as odd. Mike Duncan comments: We are probably at the nadir of "General Laws of History" being anything any historian believes, pursues, or advocates. So I don't mind Turchin's attempt. If only to voice something that nobody wants to voice anymore. — Mike Duncan (@mikeduncan) November 13, 2020

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

Consumer Sentiment: “Preliminary November 2020 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Significantly Declines Due To Republican Consumers” [Econintersect]. “Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, makes the following comments: ‘Consumer sentiment fell in early November as consumers judged future economic prospects less favorably, while their assessments of current economic conditions remained largely unchanged. The outcome of the presidential election as well as the resurgence in covid infections and deaths were responsible for the early November decline. Interviews conducted following the election recorded a substantial negative shift in the Expectations Index among Republicans, but recorded no gain among Democrats. It is likely that Democrats’ fears about the covid resurgence offset gains in economic expectations: 59% of Democrats reported that their normal life had changed to a great extent due to the coronavirus compared with just 34% among Republicans. The gap in expectations closed somewhat due to the coronavirus and the partisan shift in expectations that began well before the election. Note that Republicans now voice the least favorable economic expectations since Trump took office, and Democrats have voiced more positive expectations….

The issues seemed to begin close to the time when Apple began rolling out the new version of macOS, Big Sur—but it affected users of other versions of macOS, like Catalina and Mojave… It didn’t take long for some Mac users to note that trustd—a macOS process responsible for checking with Apple’s servers to confirm that an app is notarized—was attempting to contact a host named ocsp.apple.com but failing repeatedly.

It was the best week ever for inflows, according to BofA Global Research, in a report dated Thursday but released broadly on Friday. The investment management firm reported some $44.5 billion in flows into equity funds for the week, exceeding a flood of funds that poured into stocks back near the spring of 2018. About $38.7 billion of investor funds were pumped into exchange-traded funds, while $5.7 billion flowed into mutual funds. Investors also reduced their cash holdings by $17.8 billion, according to the report led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist.

“‘Breakthrough Finding’ Reveals Why Certain COVID Patients Die” [Kaiser Health News]. “In an international study in Science, 10% of nearly 1,000 COVID patients who developed life-threatening pneumonia had antibodies that disable key immune system proteins called interferons. These antibodies — known as autoantibodies because they attack the body itself — were not found at all in 663 people with mild or asymptomatic COVID infections . Only four of 1,227 healthy individuals had the autoantibodies. The study, published on Oct. 23, was led by the COVID Human Genetic Effort, which includes 200 research centers in 40 countries. Significantly, patients didn’t make autoantibodies in response to the virus. Instead, they appeared to have had them before the pandemic even began , said Paul Bastard, the antibody study’s lead author, also a researcher at Rockefeller University. For reasons that researchers don’t understand, the autoantibodies never caused a problem until patients were infected with COVID-19, Bastard said. Somehow, the novel coronavirus, or the immune response it triggered, appears to have set them in motion. ‘Before COVID, their condition was silent,’ Bastard said. “Most of them hadn’t gotten sick before.”

“Fewer people say they would take a COVID-19 vaccine now than 3 months ago” [World Economic Forum]. “But this latest World Economic Forum-Ipsos survey shows that confidence in taking a COVID-19 vaccine has dropped since August, with fewer people globally saying they’d get one. The survey shows that on average, across 15 countries, 73% of adults strongly or somewhat agree with the statement “if a vaccine for COVID-19 were available, I would get it”. 3 months ago, that figure was 77%. At the time, the shortfall in vaccine confidence was significant enough to be seen to compromise the effectiveness of seeing an end to the pandemic. Confidence is now down by 4 points compared to three months ago. Vaccination intent has declined in 10 of the 15 countries, most of all China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil. More than four in five in India, mainland China, South Korea, and Brazil, however, say they would get a vaccine if available – compared to just over half in France and about two in three in the US, Spain, Italy, South Africa, Japan, and Germany.”

“Poorer nations face vaccine wait as West locks down supply” [Agence France Presse]. “Hailed this week as a pandemic game-changer, the new Covid-19 vaccine offered countries that had pre-ordered doses a potential escape from a cycle of lockdowns and new waves of sickness and death. But while richer nations plan their vaccination programmes through the end of 2021, experts warn that poorer and developing countries face hurdles that could deny billions the first proven protection against the coronavirus. Vaccine developers Pfizer and BioNTech plan to roll out the first doses within weeks, once they receive emergency use permissions from drug agencies. They expect to have 1.3 billion doses ready next year. The results of phase 3 clinical trials showed their mRNA vaccine was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 symptoms and did not produce adverse side effects among thousands of volunteers.” • They didn’t effing “show it.” A press release asserted it. We haven’t seen any data.

“Pathfinder: Alabama health officer Dr. Scott Harris on a mission to guide state through COVID crisis” [Montgomery Advertiser]. “[W]ith new COVID-19 cases surging nationwide, [Dr. Scott Harris] would stand in his usual spot beside the governor as she announces that Alabama is extending its statewide mask order into December. It would remain the only state among its southeastern neighbors with such a mandate, a fact that has been widely shared with disdain and anger by anti-maskers. Ivey would also announce that the state is relaxing occupancy restrictions on businesses where masks, distancing and other sanitation rules can be maintained. More than 1,000 comments would flood the livestream of the announcement on Ivey’s official Facebook page — rage, insults, debunked misinformation, even warnings of violence. Death threats throughout the pandemic have forced Harris, a grandfather from Talladega who grew up admiring his small-town family doctor, to wear a bulletproof vest at some public appearances.”

“Stanford vs. Harvard: Two Famous Biz Schools’ Opposing Tactics on COVID” [Kaiser Health News]. “But the guts of [Harvard’s] instructions were similar to those at Stanford. Both Harvard and Stanford severely restricted who could be on campus at any given time, limiting access to students, staff members and preapproved visitors. Both required that anyone living on campus report their health daily through an online portal, checking for any symptoms that could be caused by COVID-19. Both required face coverings when outside on campus — even, a Harvard missive said, in situations ‘when physical distancing from others can be maintained.'” • Not sure how representative the Harvard and Stanford business school student bodies are, however…

COVID-19 vaccine could fundamentally change pandemic direction: WHO - Reuters IndiaA COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.GENEVA (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.

Bruce Aylward told the WHO's annual ministerial assembly that interim results from Pfizer Inc's PFE.N late-stage vaccine trial were "very positive".

“There is still much work to be done, this is just interim results...but some very positive results coming today which should hold great promise hopefully for the entire world as we move forward,” Aylward told the 194-member state forum.

“By March as a result of the extraordinary work happening globally we could be in a position to fundamentally change the direction and the dynamic of this crisis,” he added.

Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, raising hope as the pandemic accelerates with over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also welcomed the “encouraging vaccine news” in a tweet.

The Pfizer-BioNTech candidate was not among the original nine vaccines forming part of a WHO-run “COVAX” facility to finance and distribute them fairly around the world.

However, the companies have expressed interest in supplying the programme. The WHO has said more vaccines are under consideration.

Pfizer and BioNTech said they expected to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine, raising the possibility of a regulatory decision as soon as December.

Aylward gave an upbeat assessment of overall prospects.

“In diagnostics we are in a position to massively expand testing globally, in therapeutics we have sufficient tools right now to substantially reduce the risk of dying from this disease and in the area of vaccines - with the news of today especially - we are on the verge of having the readiness in place to roll out doses for high-risk populations in the late first quarter, early 2nd quarter.”

However, he warned that an “acute funding gap” of $4.5 billion could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.COVID-19 vaccine could fundamentally change pandemic direction: WHO - Reuters IndiaA COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.GENEVA (Reuters) - A COVID-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.

Biden Transition

UDPATE “Former Facebook leaders are now transition insiders” [Politico]. “But people with close ties to Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have already become inside players in the Biden transition, suggesting that the president-elect is not slamming the door on the company. Former Facebook board member Jeff Zients is co-chairing Biden’s transition team. Another former board member is an adviser. Two others — one who was a Facebook director and another who was a company lobbyist — have taken leadership roles. And Biden himself has a friendly relationship with a top Facebook executive, former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg…. One senior Democratic strategist close to the campaign put it more plainly. ‘We basically think they’re an immoral company,’ said the strategist, speaking anonymously to discuss the thinking inside the party. ‘There are thousands and thousands of people in their 20s and 30s and 40s who will be incensed to find themselves working for Secretary of Commerce Sheryl Sandberg, or taking a soft touch to Facebook because Nick Clegg and Joe Biden go way back.'” UPDATE “Could Elizabeth Warren Be the Next Treasury Secretary?” [The Nation]. • No. UPDATE Identity politics watch: White progressives training their fire on women and women of color who are under consideration to lead the nat sec departments makes me deeply uncomfortable about their allyship for those communities.

Biden (D)(1): “Biden advisers to meet vaccine firms as Trump stalls handoff” [ABC]. “Joe Biden’s scientific advisers will meet with vaccine makers in coming days as the presidential transition remains stalled because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge that he lost the election. That delayed handoff is especially problematic during a public health crisis, the government’s top infectious disease expert said…. [Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain] said Biden’s experts also need a detailed understanding of distribution plans being finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Pentagon. In some ways, that’s the more critical issue, he said.” • I’m a little frustrated by the focus on “the transition period” as a barrier to Biden explaining what his plans are. In a Parliamentary system, there would be a Shadow HHS Secretary (although nothing but, I suppose, norms prevented the Biden campaign from innovating that role. If the Democrats are worried about there being “two Presidents,” why not add a layer of indirection? Blue-skying here: Put together an enormous non-partisan conference, with tracks for all the subject matter experts. Make Biden the key-note speaker and have him give the policy speech. If the Covid is the crisis they say it is, why no? Too late for Thanksgiving, sadly, but Christmas is coming. At the very least, couldn’t Biden be addressing the nation or something? All we’re getting right now is whinging about Republican non-cooperation. That’s true, but you have to step up and lead anyhow! Biden (D)(2): “Tax filings reveal Biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries, zero on research” [New York Post]. “The Biden Cancer Initiative was founded in 2017 by the former vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, to ‘develop and drive implementation of solutions to accelerate progress in cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, research and care and to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes,’ according to its IRS mission statement. But it gave out no grants in its first two years, and spent millions on the salaries of former Washington, DC, aides it hired. The charity took in $4,809,619 in contributions in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, and spent $3,070,301 on payroll in those two years. The group’s president, Gregory Simon, raked in $429,850 in fiscal 2018 (July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019), according to the charity’s most recent federal tax filings. Simon, a former Pfizer executive and longtime health care lobbyist who headed up the White House’s cancer task force in President Barack Obama’s administration, saw his salary nearly double from the $224,539 he made in fiscal 2017, tax filings show.” Oh. Pfizer. And did the 2020 Trump campaign have any oppo capability at all? Why are we reading this only now? Harris (D)(1): “Kamala Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff breaks gender stereotypes by putting her career ahead of his as second gentleman” [USA Today]. “During a recent fundraiser, Emhoff said many of the issues he would want to focus on as second gentleman are justice related, particularly ‘ access to justice .'” • Oh. * * * OH: Coal towns all across the Ohio river valley shifted towards Republicans compared to 2016.

While it also demonstrated clear problems for the GOP, the results already have Democratic strategists privately asking frank questions about whether any of the next generation of Democratic leaders, starting with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris, can sustain enough of the coalition that elected Biden to the White House without him on the ballot. Biden may be the last Democrat who can reliably hold those Rust Belt states as the party waits for demographic change and shifting suburban attitudes to bring the Sun Belt states more securely within their reach.” • So, we’ve yoked the new “shifting suburban attitudes” theory to the old “demographic change” theory. Fine. Oh, and that’s President–elect Kamala Harris, right? UPDATE “Biden coalition built on broad but unstable foundation” [Politico]. “In what amounted to a referendum on Trump, Biden’s supporters were primarily motivated by a desire to defeat the Republican president. There is no guarantee that the disparate groups will remain together in the absence of a galvanizing opponent like Trump on the ballot.” UPDATE “Liberals Envisioned a Multiracial Coalition. Voters of Color Had Other Ideas.” [New York Times]. “The proposition seemed tailor-made for one of the nation’s most diverse and liberal states. California officials asked voters to overturn a 24-year-old ban on affirmative action in education, employment and contracting. The state political and cultural establishment worked as one to pass this ballot measure. The governor, a senator, members of Congress, university presidents and civil rights leaders called it a righting of old wrongs…. Yet on Election Day, the proposition failed by a wide margin, 57 percent to 43 percent, and Latino and Asian-American voters played a key role in defeating it. The outcome captured the gap between the vision laid out by the liberal establishment in California, which has long imagined the creation of a multiracial, multiethnic coalition that would embrace progressive causes, and the sentiments of many Black, Latino, Asian and Arab voters…. The results suggest that Democrats may need to adjust their strategy as the complexities of class, generation and experience, and the competing desires of these demographic groups become clear.” • “Become clear”?! Liberal Democrats have been pushing identity politics for decades. And only now the “complexities” become clear? What were they paying all the strategists for, anyhow?

Or take a look at years of underinvestment in public health. Why do we we assume capital formation isn’t in crisis, along with everything else? And isn’t “promising” doing a lot of work, there? UPDATE “Dynamite German film charts the banality of always looking for meaning in Hitler” [Times of Israel]. “The film draws parallels from the 1940s to today, in ways that are not really up for debate. A section on what Hitler’s use of cutting-edge microphones did for him juxtaposed with Trump’s versatility on Twitter is just plain interesting, and even folks who voted for the guy would have to agree…. Keep in mind that all footage of Hitler was produced by Hitler himself. He made it to propagate his ideology and to preserve it for generations to come. So when we make documentaries based on this material, we are, in a way, propagating the propaganda… The Soviet representation of Hitler was fascinating. Stalin had this whole thing, which we include in the film, about how he didn’t shoot himself, he poisoned himself “like a bitch.” Really saying he wasn’t a real man, a whole machismo angle. Of course, so much of our understanding about Hitler is from wartime propaganda — ideas like his alleged Jewish roots, or a drug addict, or he only had one testicle. In many cases, these are also fabrications.” • The whole interview is well worth a read. Interesting true fact about Hitler’s microphones. UPDATE “‘The Meaning of Hitler’ Review: Terrifying Proof That Fascism Can Happen Anywhere” [Yahoo Entertainment]. “The movie’s ultimate thesis — that Nazis were normal people who did awful things — doesn’t exactly unearth new insights into the nature of the Third Reich, but it lingers on the humanity of Hitler just enough to bolster its disturbing raison d’être. Whether that comes from closeups of the shoddy watercolors from his failed first career as a street artist (for which an art historian offers a blunt assessment) or roaming the mountainous regions where he forged his ethereal man-of-the-Aryan-people brand, ‘The Meaning of Hitler’ excels at assembling an exploratory nonfiction biopic.” UPDATE I support the tropes: After the Ilhan Omar “all about the benjamins” mega-scandal I farsightedly called for a federal Trope Police, which I now think should be supplemented by a corps of well-funded, heavily armed Slogan Cops#PoliceReform — Savvy & Realistic Democrat (@RealisticDemoc1) November 14, 2020 Well, we should certainly include them in the training sets of AI moderators on social media.

The idea being: you buy a printer, you sign up for the Instant Ink free tier, and get enough supplies gratis to print a few things a month during the device’s lifetime. Well, not anymore: the free tier is being scrapped, and now folks have to pay. Below is a typical email sent to customers at the end of last month. One print-free-for-life reader told us he has to start paying HP a monthly fee from December 26, or his printer will stop working unless he buys his own fresh cartridges. The fees start from $0.99 a month for 15 pages, just like the free tier albeit with the ability to rollover up to 45 unused pages.”

“How To Spot Wildlife In The City: Tips From An Urban Naturalist” [Euronews]. “With British towns teeming with wildlife, I started to realise that becoming an urban naturalist has never been easier – and anyone can do it. Mental health experts have shown that spending time in nature can be extremely positive for our wellbeing and it gets us away from the daily stress and pressures of city lifestyle. Crucially, the more of us take an interest in the wildlife in our cities, the more local government will have to plan with animals in mind. We’ll demand cleaner waterways, more trees and larger green spaces. Bricks can be modified into homes for migratory swifts and insects can benefit too. For instance, tree bumblebees that have moved through Europe into the UK, are currently nesting in a bird box in my garden. Fascinating, charismatic species can be found right next to where you live. By taking an interest in our local ecosystems, learning about the species that surround us, and preserving our most biodiverse regions, we can ensure a sustainable future for all city-dwellers. The first step is to get outside and look.” • I’m sure this is true everywhere, not just the UK!

UPDATE “Salty rivers, failed durian trees and waves consuming the shore: Climate change realities hit Gulf of Thailand” [Channel News Asia]. “Thailand is a low lying country, which is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise driven by climate change. Combined with coastal erosion and long periods of drought, the lack of fresh water, especially in provinces close to the sea, is becoming problematic. ‘It’s natural that the amount of saltwater mass intrusion depends on the fresh water that comes from the mountains. If the freshwater mass is big, it will push the salt water out,’ said Assistant Professor Payom Rattanamanee, a riverine and coastal engineer at Prince of Songkla University. ‘But in drought season, when the fresh water doesn’t have power, the salt water which has more density will push itself into canals and rivers more,’ he said. As a result, underground water resources have been contaminated, important river systems face serious saltwater intrusion and farmers are seeing their crops fail. Critically, some drinking water resources, including in the capital city, are turning saline.”

UPDATE “Satellite observations reveal extreme methane leakage from a natural gas well blowout” [PNAS]. “Emissions from the fossil fuel industry are one of the major sources of atmospheric methane. Gas leakages due to accidents in the oil and gas sector can release large amounts of methane within short periods of time. Although these emissions are very challenging to monitor, satellite measurement platforms offer a promising approach by regularly scanning the entire globe. This study demonstrates this capability of satellite measurements by reporting atmospheric measurements of methane emission from a natural gas well blowout in Ohio in 2018. Assuming a constant emission rate during the whole event, we find the total methane emission from the 20-d blowout to be equivalent to a substantial fraction of the annual total anthropogenic emission of several European countries.” • Here’s video footage. Yes, it’s fracking. Of course.

UPDATE “How a Human Cousin Adapted to a Changing Climate” [New York Times]. “The change [in chewing muscles] would have been the result of microevolution, or an evolutionary change occurring within a species. Such a morphological change, the scientists said, was likely the result of P. robustus adapting to that changing climate, with members of the species who were able to get enough nutrition from a change in their food supply surviving, and passing their traits to offspring.” • So there’s hope, then!

“Moderna says its coronavirus vaccine is 94.5% effective against COVID-19, a crucial victory in the fight against the pandemic” [Business Insider]. “The upstart biotech Moderna announced the success Monday morning in a press release, saying its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. An independent group of experts found clear signs of effectiveness after reviewing preliminary data from an ongoing 30,000-person study, Moderna said…. Moderna’s analysis was based on 95 COVID-19 cases, while Pfizer’s review included 94 cases. Neither company’s data has been published in a scientific journal, and both are still collecting more information on how safe their shots are.” • So not time to declare victory yet.

“2nd virus vaccine shows overwhelming success in U.S. tests” [Associated Press]. “Pfizer’s [vaccine] must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures — around minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Moderna’s vaccine also starts off frozen, but the company said Monday it can be thawed and kept in a regular refrigerator for 30 days, easing that concern.”

Weirdly, there’s also an Editor’s Note: “This article was published on July 14, 2020, at NEJM.org.” “We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. There were 15 participants in each dose group…. The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine.” • This the Moderna vaccine

“How to Avoid a Surprise Bill for Your Coronavirus Test” [New York Times]. “Congress wrote rules in March that aimed to make coronavirus testing free for all Americans. Patients, with or without insurance, have found holes in those new coverage programs. They’ve faced bills that range from a few dollars to over $1,000. I’ve spent much of the past four months collecting patients’ bills related to coronavirus. As part of that project, I’ve read through more than 100 patient stories about coronavirus tests. Many patients are happy to report no charge at all, while others have been billed large unexpected fees or denied claims related to coronavirus tests. The surprise bills have hit uninsured Americans as well as those with robust coverage. The health data firm Castlight estimates that 2.4 percent of coronavirus test bills leave some share of the charge to consumers, which means there could be millions of patients facing fees they did not expect. These are some simple steps you can take to lower your chances of becoming one of them.” Step one: “If you can, get tested at a public site.” • Whaddya know.

“Surging virus cases get a shrug in many Midwestern towns” [Associated Press]. “‘We have an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old, and we certainly believe this is an important time of life to maybe shine a little bit,’ [Jay Stibbe] said. “We’re trying to create as much normalcy as we can. We try not to live in fear. We’ve traveled. We go out to dinner.” In Plattsmouth, Nebraska, Karen Prohaska, 76, said she generally doesn’t wear a mask in her downtown purse and jewelry shop but will put one on at the request of a customer. When customers come into the store with a face covering, she asks if they’d like her to don one as well. Most say no and ask if it’s OK for them to remove theirs. ‘I hope that I don’t get the virus, but I’ve never really been a germophobe,’ Prohaska said. The pandemic hasn’t stopped Mary Gerteisen, of Eagle, Nebraska, from visiting her 96-year-old father on weekends to watch football. Gerteisen said she understands the risks, given her father’s age and vulnerability, but she also weighed the fact that he’s in the early stages of dementia and often believes family members have abandoned him. ‘There are times when I think that I do need to take the pandemic more seriously,’ she said. ‘But I want to see my dad, and I don’t know much longer I have with him. I would love for him to live to 100-some years old, but if he comes down with (the virus), he’s lived a good, long life.” • “Maybe shine a little bit” is so, so sad…

Discussing data not as an object of transactions or an object of governance, but as a tool for governing others on a scale that rivals that of nation states with their law, seems a fitting topic for a special issue that is devoted to the legal construction of markets. Here, I argue that while it may well be the case that law constitutes markets, markets are not the only way in which economic relations may be organized, and law is not the only feasible mode of governing these relations. Central planning under socialism posed an alternative, which proved ultimately non-viable. The rise of big tech companies (Big Tech) and their accumulation of vast amounts of data offers yet another possibility: the rule by data.” • The first paragraph. Throws down the gauntlet, doesn’t it?

Biden Transition

UDPATE “Former Facebook leaders are now transition insiders” [Politico]. “But people with close ties to Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have already become inside players in the Biden transition, suggesting that the president-elect is not slamming the door on the company. Former Facebook board member Jeff Zients is co-chairing Biden’s transition team. Another former board member is an adviser. Two others — one who was a Facebook director and another who was a company lobbyist — have taken leadership roles. And Biden himself has a friendly relationship with a top Facebook executive, former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg…. One senior Democratic strategist close to the campaign put it more plainly. ‘We basically think they’re an immoral company,’ said the strategist, speaking anonymously to discuss the thinking inside the party. ‘There are thousands and thousands of people in their 20s and 30s and 40s who will be incensed to find themselves working for Secretary of Commerce Sheryl Sandberg, or taking a soft touch to Facebook because Nick Clegg and Joe Biden go way back.'” UPDATE “Could Elizabeth Warren Be the Next Treasury Secretary?” [The Nation]. • No. UPDATE Identity politics watch: White progressives training their fire on women and women of color who are under consideration to lead the nat sec departments makes me deeply uncomfortable about their allyship for those communities.

2020

Biden (D)(1): “Biden advisers to meet vaccine firms as Trump stalls handoff” [ABC]. “Joe Biden’s scientific advisers will meet with vaccine makers in coming days as the presidential transition remains stalled because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge that he lost the election. That delayed handoff is especially problematic during a public health crisis, the government’s top infectious disease expert said…. [Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain] said Biden’s experts also need a detailed understanding of distribution plans being finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Pentagon. In some ways, that’s the more critical issue, he said.” • I’m a little frustrated by the focus on “the transition period” as a barrier to Biden explaining what his plans are. In a Parliamentary system, there would be a Shadow HHS Secretary (although nothing but, I suppose, norms prevented the Biden campaign from innovating that role. If the Democrats are worried about there being “two Presidents,” why not add a layer of indirection? Blue-skying here: Put together an enormous non-partisan conference, with tracks for all the subject matter experts. Make Biden the key-note speaker and have him give the policy speech. If the Covid is the crisis they say it is, why no? Too late for Thanksgiving, sadly, but Christmas is coming. At the very least, couldn’t Biden be addressing the nation or something? All we’re getting right now is whinging about Republican non-cooperation. That’s true, but you have to step up and lead anyhow! Biden (D)(2): “Tax filings reveal Biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries, zero on research” [New York Post]. “The Biden Cancer Initiative was founded in 2017 by the former vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, to ‘develop and drive implementation of solutions to accelerate progress in cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, research and care and to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes,’ according to its IRS mission statement. But it gave out no grants in its first two years, and spent millions on the salaries of former Washington, DC, aides it hired. The charity took in $4,809,619 in contributions in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, and spent $3,070,301 on payroll in those two years. The group’s president, Gregory Simon, raked in $429,850 in fiscal 2018 (July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019), according to the charity’s most recent federal tax filings. Simon, a former Pfizer executive and longtime health care lobbyist who headed up the White House’s cancer task force in President Barack Obama’s administration, saw his salary nearly double from the $224,539 he made in fiscal 2017, tax filings show.” Oh. Pfizer. And did the 2020 Trump campaign have any oppo capability at all? Why are we reading this only now? Harris (D)(1): “Kamala Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff breaks gender stereotypes by putting her career ahead of his as second gentleman” [USA Today]. “During a recent fundraiser, Emhoff said many of the issues he would want to focus on as second gentleman are justice related, particularly ‘ access to justice .'” • Oh. * * * OH: Coal towns all across the Ohio river valley shifted towards Republicans compared to 2016.

While it also demonstrated clear problems for the GOP, the results already have Democratic strategists privately asking frank questions about whether any of the next generation of Democratic leaders, starting with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris, can sustain enough of the coalition that elected Biden to the White House without him on the ballot. Biden may be the last Democrat who can reliably hold those Rust Belt states as the party waits for demographic change and shifting suburban attitudes to bring the Sun Belt states more securely within their reach.” • So, we’ve yoked the new “shifting suburban attitudes” theory to the old “demographic change” theory. Fine. Oh, and that’s President–elect Kamala Harris, right? UPDATE “Biden coalition built on broad but unstable foundation” [Politico]. “In what amounted to a referendum on Trump, Biden’s supporters were primarily motivated by a desire to defeat the Republican president. There is no guarantee that the disparate groups will remain together in the absence of a galvanizing opponent like Trump on the ballot.” UPDATE “Liberals Envisioned a Multiracial Coalition. Voters of Color Had Other Ideas.” [New York Times]. “The proposition seemed tailor-made for one of the nation’s most diverse and liberal states. California officials asked voters to overturn a 24-year-old ban on affirmative action in education, employment and contracting. The state political and cultural establishment worked as one to pass this ballot measure. The governor, a senator, members of Congress, university presidents and civil rights leaders called it a righting of old wrongs…. Yet on Election Day, the proposition failed by a wide margin, 57 percent to 43 percent, and Latino and Asian-American voters played a key role in defeating it. The outcome captured the gap between the vision laid out by the liberal establishment in California, which has long imagined the creation of a multiracial, multiethnic coalition that would embrace progressive causes, and the sentiments of many Black, Latino, Asian and Arab voters…. The results suggest that Democrats may need to adjust their strategy as the complexities of class, generation and experience, and the competing desires of these demographic groups become clear.” • “Become clear”?! Liberal Democrats have been pushing identity politics for decades. And only now the “complexities” become clear? What were they paying all the strategists for, anyhow?

“Rethinking the future of American capitalism” [McKinsey & Company]. “Capitalism’s effectiveness in directing capital formation toward the most promising investments has implications for market structure and concentration of economic power.” • Why do we assume this? Uber? Unicorns? There’s so much stupid money sloshing around we don’t know where to invest it, and at the same time we can’t build a new Amtrak tunnel under the Hudson when we know the existing tunnel is doomed. Or take a look at years of underinvestment in public health. Why do we we assume capital formation isn’t in crisis, along with everything else? And isn’t “promising” doing a lot of work, there? UPDATE “Dynamite German film charts the banality of always looking for meaning in Hitler” [Times of Israel]. “The film draws parallels from the 1940s to today, in ways that are not really up for debate. A section on what Hitler’s use of cutting-edge microphones did for him juxtaposed with Trump’s versatility on Twitter is just plain interesting, and even folks who voted for the guy would have to agree…. Keep in mind that all footage of Hitler was produced by Hitler himself. He made it to propagate his ideology and to preserve it for generations to come. So when we make documentaries based on this material, we are, in a way, propagating the propaganda… The Soviet representation of Hitler was fascinating. Stalin had this whole thing, which we include in the film, about how he didn’t shoot himself, he poisoned himself “like a bitch.” Really saying he wasn’t a real man, a whole machismo angle. Of course, so much of our understanding about Hitler is from wartime propaganda — ideas like his alleged Jewish roots, or a drug addict, or he only had one testicle. In many cases, these are also fabrications.” • The whole interview is well worth a read. Interesting true fact about Hitler’s microphones. UPDATE “‘The Meaning of Hitler’ Review: Terrifying Proof That Fascism Can Happen Anywhere” [Yahoo Entertainment]. “The movie’s ultimate thesis — that Nazis were normal people who did awful things — doesn’t exactly unearth new insights into the nature of the Third Reich, but it lingers on the humanity of Hitler just enough to bolster its disturbing raison d’être. Whether that comes from closeups of the shoddy watercolors from his failed first career as a street artist (for which an art historian offers a blunt assessment) or roaming the mountainous regions where he forged his ethereal man-of-the-Aryan-people brand, ‘The Meaning of Hitler’ excels at assembling an exploratory nonfiction biopic.” UPDATE I support the tropes: After the Ilhan Omar “all about the benjamins” mega-scandal I farsightedly called for a federal Trope Police, which I now think should be supplemented by a corps of well-funded, heavily armed Slogan Cops#PoliceReform — Savvy & Realistic Democrat (@RealisticDemoc1) November 14, 2020 Well, we should certainly include them in the training sets of AI moderators on social media.

Well, now it’s pay-per-month to continue using your printer ink” [The Register]. “For users who don’t need to print much, and to lure folks into the subscription system, HP marketed a print-free-for-life tier that cost nothing, though it was limited to 15 pages a month, and $1 per 10 additional pages. The idea being: you buy a printer, you sign up for the Instant Ink free tier, and get enough supplies gratis to print a few things a month during the device’s lifetime. Well, not anymore: the free tier is being scrapped, and now folks have to pay. Below is a typical email sent to customers at the end of last month. One print-free-for-life reader told us he has to start paying HP a monthly fee from December 26, or his printer will stop working unless he buys his own fresh cartridges. The fees start from $0.99 a month for 15 pages, just like the free tier albeit with the ability to rollover up to 45 unused pages.”

The Biosphere

“How To Spot Wildlife In The City: Tips From An Urban Naturalist” [Euronews]. “With British towns teeming with wildlife, I started to realise that becoming an urban naturalist has never been easier – and anyone can do it. Mental health experts have shown that spending time in nature can be extremely positive for our wellbeing and it gets us away from the daily stress and pressures of city lifestyle. Crucially, the more of us take an interest in the wildlife in our cities, the more local government will have to plan with animals in mind. We’ll demand cleaner waterways, more trees and larger green spaces. Bricks can be modified into homes for migratory swifts and insects can benefit too. For instance, tree bumblebees that have moved through Europe into the UK, are currently nesting in a bird box in my garden. Fascinating, charismatic species can be found right next to where you live. By taking an interest in our local ecosystems, learning about the species that surround us, and preserving our most biodiverse regions, we can ensure a sustainable future for all city-dwellers. The first step is to get outside and look.” • I’m sure this is true everywhere, not just the UK!

UPDATE “Salty rivers, failed durian trees and waves consuming the shore: Climate change realities hit Gulf of Thailand” [Channel News Asia]. “Thailand is a low lying country, which is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise driven by climate change. Combined with coastal erosion and long periods of drought, the lack of fresh water, especially in provinces close to the sea, is becoming problematic. ‘It’s natural that the amount of saltwater mass intrusion depends on the fresh water that comes from the mountains. If the freshwater mass is big, it will push the salt water out,’ said Assistant Professor Payom Rattanamanee, a riverine and coastal engineer at Prince of Songkla University. ‘But in drought season, when the fresh water doesn’t have power, the salt water which has more density will push itself into canals and rivers more,’ he said. As a result, underground water resources have been contaminated, important river systems face serious saltwater intrusion and farmers are seeing their crops fail. Critically, some drinking water resources, including in the capital city, are turning saline.”

UPDATE “Satellite observations reveal extreme methane leakage from a natural gas well blowout” [PNAS]. “Emissions from the fossil fuel industry are one of the major sources of atmospheric methane. Gas leakages due to accidents in the oil and gas sector can release large amounts of methane within short periods of time. Although these emissions are very challenging to monitor, satellite measurement platforms offer a promising approach by regularly scanning the entire globe. This study demonstrates this capability of satellite measurements by reporting atmospheric measurements of methane emission from a natural gas well blowout in Ohio in 2018. Assuming a constant emission rate during the whole event, we find the total methane emission from the 20-d blowout to be equivalent to a substantial fraction of the annual total anthropogenic emission of several European countries.” • Here’s video footage. Yes, it’s fracking. Of course.

UPDATE “How a Human Cousin Adapted to a Changing Climate” [New York Times]. “The change [in chewing muscles] would have been the result of microevolution, or an evolutionary change occurring within a species. Such a morphological change, the scientists said, was likely the result of P. robustus adapting to that changing climate, with members of the species who were able to get enough nutrition from a change in their food supply surviving, and passing their traits to offspring.” • So there’s hope, then!

“Moderna says its coronavirus vaccine is 94.5% effective against COVID-19, a crucial victory in the fight against the pandemic” [Business Insider]. “The upstart biotech Moderna announced the success Monday morning in a press release, saying its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. An independent group of experts found clear signs of effectiveness after reviewing preliminary data from an ongoing 30,000-person study, Moderna said…. Moderna’s analysis was based on 95 COVID-19 cases, while Pfizer’s review included 94 cases. Neither company’s data has been published in a scientific journal, and both are still collecting more information on how safe their shots are.” • So not time to declare victory yet.

“2nd virus vaccine shows overwhelming success in U.S. tests” [Associated Press]. “Pfizer’s [vaccine] must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures — around minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Moderna’s vaccine also starts off frozen, but the company said Monday it can be thawed and kept in a regular refrigerator for 30 days, easing that concern.”

“An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 — Preliminary Report” [Nature]. The article is dated November 12, 2020. Weirdly, there’s also an Editor’s Note: “This article was published on July 14, 2020, at NEJM.org.” “We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg. There were 15 participants in each dose group…. The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine.” • This the Moderna vaccine

“How to Avoid a Surprise Bill for Your Coronavirus Test” [New York Times]. “Congress wrote rules in March that aimed to make coronavirus testing free for all Americans. Patients, with or without insurance, have found holes in those new coverage programs. They’ve faced bills that range from a few dollars to over $1,000. I’ve spent much of the past four months collecting patients’ bills related to coronavirus. As part of that project, I’ve read through more than 100 patient stories about coronavirus tests. Many patients are happy to report no charge at all, while others have been billed large unexpected fees or denied claims related to coronavirus tests. The surprise bills have hit uninsured Americans as well as those with robust coverage. The health data firm Castlight estimates that 2.4 percent of coronavirus test bills leave some share of the charge to consumers, which means there could be millions of patients facing fees they did not expect. These are some simple steps you can take to lower your chances of becoming one of them.” Step one: “If you can, get tested at a public site.” • Whaddya know.

“Surging virus cases get a shrug in many Midwestern towns” [Associated Press]. “‘We have an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old, and we certainly believe this is an important time of life to maybe shine a little bit,’ [Jay Stibbe] said. “We’re trying to create as much normalcy as we can. We try not to live in fear. We’ve traveled. We go out to dinner.” In Plattsmouth, Nebraska, Karen Prohaska, 76, said she generally doesn’t wear a mask in her downtown purse and jewelry shop but will put one on at the request of a customer. When customers come into the store with a face covering, she asks if they’d like her to don one as well. Most say no and ask if it’s OK for them to remove theirs. ‘I hope that I don’t get the virus, but I’ve never really been a germophobe,’ Prohaska said. The pandemic hasn’t stopped Mary Gerteisen, of Eagle, Nebraska, from visiting her 96-year-old father on weekends to watch football. Gerteisen said she understands the risks, given her father’s age and vulnerability, but she also weighed the fact that he’s in the early stages of dementia and often believes family members have abandoned him. ‘There are times when I think that I do need to take the pandemic more seriously,’ she said. ‘But I want to see my dad, and I don’t know much longer I have with him. I would love for him to live to 100-some years old, but if he comes down with (the virus), he’s lived a good, long life.” • “Maybe shine a little bit” is so, so sad…

Discussing data not as an object of transactions or an object of governance, but as a tool for governing others on a scale that rivals that of nation states with their law, seems a fitting topic for a special issue that is devoted to the legal construction of markets. Here, I argue that while it may well be the case that law constitutes markets, markets are not the only way in which economic relations may be organized, and law is not the only feasible mode of governing these relations. Central planning under socialism posed an alternative, which proved ultimately non-viable. The rise of big tech companies (Big Tech) and their accumulation of vast amounts of data offers yet another possibility: the rule by data.” • The first paragraph. Throws down the gauntlet, doesn’t it?

North Korean Malware Helps Hackers Target #COVID19 VaccinesKimsuky Group’s info-stealing malware has sophisticated anti-evasion featuresSecurity researchers have discovered new North Korean malware being used to drive information-stealing attacks against COVID-19 vaccine makers and other targets.

Cybereason Nocturnus said it had been able to track new attack infrastructure linked to the prolific Kimsuky group via BabyShark and AppleSeed malware previously attributed to it.

The new domains created as part of this push were all registered to the same IP address responsible for BabyShark attacks, the vendor said.

Whilst investigating, it uncovered a new malware suite dubbed “KGH” spread via weaponized Word documents in phishing emails and containing multiple spyware modules. Recipients are encouraged to open the attachment, which purports to contain either an interview with a North Korean defector or a letter addressed to former Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe.

KGH’s infostealer module, which remained undetected by AV tools at the time of writing, harvests data from browsers, Windows Credential Manager, WINSCP and mail clients.

Separately, Cybereason detected a new downloader, “CSPY,” which it said “is packed with robust evasion techniques meant to ensure that the ‘coast is clear’ and that the malware does not run in a context of a virtual machine or analysis tools before it continues to download secondary payloads.”

After payloads are downloaded they are removed and renamed, the main payload masquerades as a legitimate Windows service, and exploits a known UAC bypass technique using the SilentCleanup task to execute the binary with elevated privileges.

Cybereason uncovered additional efforts designed to confound white hat researchers, including the manipulation of timestamps and file compilation data to thwart forensics. In this case, most files were falsely backdated to 2016.

Alongside COVID-19 vaccine makers, the group has apparently targeted the UN Security Council, South Korean government, research institutes, think tanks, journalists and the military.North Korean Malware Helps Hackers Target #COVID19 VaccinesKimsuky Group’s info-stealing malware has sophisticated anti-evasion featuresSecurity researchers have discovered new North Korean malware being used to drive information-stealing attacks against COVID-19 vaccine makers and other targets.

How people reacted to Pfizer, Moderna declaring their COVID-19 vaccines workMany Indians claimed their parents would demand 100 per cent effectiveness, while others shared memes about the impact of these vaccines.Pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna announced that their vaccine candidates have shown success in late-stage trials, prompting a range of reactions on social media. While Moderna has claimed their vaccine is 94.5 per cent effective, Pfizer has said its candidate has shown an effectiveness of 95 per cent.

These announcements have prompted a wave of reactions on social media. Many Indians said that parents here might have questioned why these vacccines weren’t 100 per cent effective. Others shared GIFs and jokes about the potential availability of the vaccine.

Bird Song of the Day

I hope that white noise in the background is the sea…

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Case count by United States region:

There’s a drawing back from the vertical, perhaps somehow related to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.

To break it down a little, here’s the Midwest:

Certainly an improvement in the Dakotas, and elsewhere.

Test positivity by region:

Positivity (blue) seems to have plateaued in the Midwest. Still the giant drop in the South (green). Nowhere near 3%, though.

Hospitalization by region:

Hospitalization seems to have plateaued in the South. Nearly.

Case fatality rate by region:

Deaths (purple dotted) heading toward vertical, as they will for until the surge in cases works its way through the pipeline (ugh, what a way to think, it’s like being a World War One general).

CA: “S.F. was flattening the curve — until our urge to gather spiked it. Now we need to reverse the surge” [San Francisco Chronicle]. “In early October, just 27 people a day tested positive in the city, which sat in the state’s yellow tier, meaning the virus risk was “minimal.” That allowed the city to open restaurants for indoor dining at 25% capacity and loosen other restrictions. But a few weeks can bring a dramatic change of fate — especially in the miserable year that is 2020. Now, San Francisco sits in the red tier, meaning the virus spread is “substantial,” and 105 people in the city receive a positive test result every day. … So what happened? Despite the city’s repeated insistence on following data, science and facts, we don’t have the data, science or facts to identify the exact problem spots. The city’s contact tracing system isn’t good enough to pinpoint specific events, gatherings, businesses or other places that are fueling the surge…. Jon Jacobo, a co-chair of the Latino Task Force, helps run a weekly test site in the Mission and said it’s clear indoor dining and casual gatherings led to a rise in cases. He said the fact that the health department allowed indoor dining — without masks as people ate and drank — led some people to assume it was safe to have friends and family over for dinner in their own homes without masks.”

NY: “Secret plans helped Brooklyn synagogue pull off massive, maskless wedding” [New York Post]. “A Hasidic synagogue in Brooklyn planned the wedding of a chief rabbi’s grandson with such secrecy, it was able to host thousands of maskless celebrants without the city catching on. Despite a surge in COVID-19 cases, guests crammed shoulder to shoulder inside the Yetev Lev temple in Williamsburg for the Nov. 8 nuptials — stomping, dancing and singing at the top of their lungs without a mask in sight, videos obtained by The Post show… ‘In recent weeks, organizers worked tirelessly to arrange everything in the best way possible. All notices about upcoming celebrations were passed along through word of mouth, with no notices in writing, no posters on the synagogue walls, no invitations sent through the mail, nor even a report in any publication, including this very newspaper,’ [according to Der Blatt].” • Behavior not peculiar to the Hasidim, I might add.

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord

“Sidney Powell Not Part of Trump’s Legal Team, Says Rudy Giuliani” [WSJ]. • That was fast. Woo woo. “In Election Litigation, An Ominous Sign” [Washington Monthly]. “One of their arguments was that the state court had violated the U.S. Constitution by applying the Pennsylvania Constitution at all. This, they said, violated the ‘elections clause,’ Article I § 4, which provides that ‘[t]he times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the Legislature thereof’ unless Congress passes a law governing those things. Here’s the core of the argument: the provision, they argued, says, ‘legislatures.’ It does not say ‘legislatures and state courts.’ It does not say ‘legislatures, state courts, and state constitutions.’ …. Read that way, the U.S. Constitution, which supersedes any state law or constitution, gives the state legislatures a federal function ‘independent’ of its function in the state. So, Republicans argued, the people of the state could not guarantee themselves a right to vote in federal elections, whatever they might put in their state constitution…. This is the “independent state legislature doctrine.'” • I don’t know who invented the “independent state legislature doctrine.” My guess would be John C. Calhoun. He’s right (1):

Trump has got liberals worshipping the integrity of insecure electronic voting machines. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) November 20, 2020

“The Memo: Trump plows ahead with efforts to overturn election” [The Hill]. “An Economist/YouGov poll conducted earlier this week found that 84 percent of Republican voters do not believe Biden’s election victory to be legitimate. Such a high number is a major problem, given that democracies only function when there is a widespread consensus on such basic facts as the outcome of elections.” • I don’t recall a similar poll being done back when the Steele Dossier was going to be a thing….

This is a good thread on being an election observer:

Biden Transition

UPDATE “The National Security Revolving Door Starts Spinning” [David Sirota, Daily Poster]. “On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Biden has chosen his longtime aide, Tony Blinken, to serve as Secretary of State and will name Jake Sullivan, his senior advisor and a former Hillary Clinton aide, national security adviser. Former Obama Defense Department official Michèle Flournoy is considered the favorite to be Secretary of Defense. After leaving the Obama administration, Blinken and Flournoy founded WestExec Advisors, a secretive consulting firm whose motto has been: “Bringing the Situation Room to the board room.” Flournoy and Sullivan have both held roles at think tanks raking in money from defense contractors and U.S. government intelligence and defense agencies. Last week, two board members from Raytheon joined a small group to brief President-elect Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on national security issues. One of the two Raytheon board members, Robert Work, has also worked for WestExec.” • See, children? Blinken is fine: A secretary of state who cares about refugees….

What do they do instead? Emit faint semi-liquid noises, as of shaken gelatin? Sanders team on Blinken (1): Solid choice. Leaders around the world will assume that when Blinken speaks, he speaks for Biden https://t.co/GLoIjS6TGi https://t.co/SMZxMrQuqS — Faiz (@fshakir) November 23, 2020 Sanders team on Blinken (2): This is a good choice. Tony has the strong confidence of the president-elect and the knowledge and experience for the important work of rebuilding US diplomacy. It will also be a new and great thing to have a top diplomat who has regularly engaged with progressive grassroots. https://t.co/NglVbp9YCa — Matt Duss (@mattduss) November 23, 2020 Makes Faiz and Duss realists, I suppose. After all, Biden’s Secretary of State could have been Pete Buttigieg (“He speaks thirty-two languages!”). Or Hillary Clinton. And then there’s Jake Sullivan: Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was one of the key people in the group formed by CIA, Dems & neocons — including (of course) Bill Kristol, Mike Chertoff, Mike Morell, Mike Rogers, Podesta, etc. — urging more belligerence toward Moscowhttps://t.co/iKjKyJc0Xy — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 23, 2020 “Biden’s COVID Plan Is Better Than Trump’s, But Still Far From Sufficient” [Truthout]. “Indeed, a particular brand of science underlies the plan, setting the needs of the donor class ahead of stopping the COVID outbreak in any rapid order. The plan, for one, calls for hiring 100,000 Americans as part of a Public Health Job Corps to aid in contact tracing. That certainly sounds like a lot, but isn’t nearly enough by an order of magnitude…. The Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity at George Washington University offers a county-level U.S. map of estimates of the number of contact-trace workers needed based on population size, tracer workforce and the present outbreak load. Even under heroic assumptions as to what contact tracers can accomplish daily, the projected personnel needed exceeds the Biden plan’s capacity. For example, the metropolitan regions of Minneapolis and St. Paul alone would need 6,000 of those 100,000 tracers the Biden transition team proposes, hardly anywhere near what is necessary to control the outbreak, even combined with the measly efforts by the states so far. Of course, contact tracing depends on a lot more than infections and workforce. As ProPublica describes, counties with meatpacking-driven outbreaks are having great difficulty tracking cases among immigrants, many of whom speak other languages, don’t have phones or don’t want contact with state officials for reasons of immigration status under Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So why the numbers gap between infections and Biden’s contact tracers? The political class here simply can’t afford the possibility that U.S. governance in late empire, focused on corporations and the stock market first, suddenly would be centered on hiring the American people to help the American people. FDR bunting is being placed on an austerity parade float.” • If Biden only jumps halfway across the abyss, it doesn’t really matter that Trump jumped only one-quarter of the way.

2020

Biden (D)(1): “House of Cards” [Mother Jones (nippersmom)]. “But the most controversial item on the banks’ agenda, and the one that would require the most legwork from Biden, was bankruptcy reform…. A 2008 study published in the American Bankruptcy Law Journal found that “credit card companies saved billions because of reduced loan loss rates,” but that none of those savings benefited consumers. Because interest rates and late fees continued to tick upward, ‘the cost to credit card customers increased 5% to 17%.’ And even before the recession hit, Credit Suisse found that the bankruptcy law had ‘a profound impact on subprime borrowers’ and made it more likely that borrowers would fail on their bankruptcy payment plans. ‘Before that law was passed you could file a chapter 7 bankruptcy for seven, eight, nine-hundred dollars, including attorney’s fees and filing fees, and that’s gone up to more like $2,000,’ Sommer said. “It’s made bankruptcy much more expensive, difficult, burdensome, and less effective.’ The number of personal bankruptcy filings has fallen by half in 15 years.” • This is a long and very detailed exposé of the state of Delaware, whiffy out of all proportion to its size, and Biden’s role in servicing the credit card companies and banks located there. It’s worth grabbing a cup of coffee and reading in full, becuase it shows the kind of politics that Biden would regard as successful. Even moral. Biden (D)(2): “The Biden Campaign’s Decision Not To Knock on Doors Was a Huge Mistake” [Jacobin]. “The Biden campaign drastically scaled back on door knockers, ceding ground to Republicans in crucial states. Throughout the summer and fall, Biden staffers and their allies argued the risk of contracting COVID-19 and spreading it to others outweighed whatever gains in-person canvassers could make on the ground.” • But when Sanders had to be forced from the race, in-person voting was encouraged! Trump (R)(1): “Trump ally Stephen Moore: President ‘going to leave the office triumphant'” [The Hill]. “Stephen Moore, an economist and outside adviser to President Trump, said he thinks the president will leave office ‘triumphant,’ pointing to optimistic projections for the economy and noting the announcement that a COVID-19 vaccine could be just weeks away. ‘I think [Trump] is going to leave the office triumphant. … By early next year, we will have a vaccine that nobody thought was possible,’ Moore said during an interview with John Catsimatidis on his radio show on WABC 770 AM that aired Sunday.” • Musical interlude…. * * * “How Biden swung the religious vote” [Politico]. “Between 47 percent and 50 percent of Catholic voters supported Trump — a small decline from 2016, but enough to cost him the Rust Belt states that mattered most to his path to victory. Nationally, the president carried white Catholics by a 15-point margin, according to AP/VoteCast data, marking a significant decline from his 33-point margin of victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Trump’s slippage with white evangelicals was less pronounced — surveys showed him carrying 76 percent to 78 percent of the white, born-again Christian vote — a slight decrease from 2016, when he won support from about 8 in 10 white evangelicals. But it had far-reaching implications for the president in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, where current vote totals show him losing by less than 1 percent.” FL: “How Hispanic Voters Swung Miami Right” [New York Times]. “[In Miami-Dade] 58 percent of the electorate is Hispanic and Mr. Trump made huge inroads from 2016 to 2020. Hundreds of thousands more people voted for him this year, and though he still lost the county to Joseph R. Biden Jr., he improved his margin over 2016 by 22 percentage points, a swing that helped him easily win Florida and sweep a slew of local Republicans into office. Much has been said about how Latinos in many parts of the country, while still favoring Mr. Biden in large numbers, voted more Republican than in 2016. But South Florida is a unique case study. No other place has quite the same mix of Republican-friendly Hispanics, led by conservative Cuban-Americans. And the Trump presidency has strengthened their hand, forcing Miami to reckon with hard and contradictory truths about immigration, racism and power.” • It seems our strategy of encouraging Latin American oligarchs and regime hard men to immigrate here has had its desired effect, at least in Miami. Though not everywhere– “Culture wars fuel Trump’s blue-collar Latino gains” [Politico]. “Despite four years of being defined as a racist for his rhetoric and harsh immigration policies, Trump improved his margins in 78 of the nation’s 100 majority-Hispanic counties. And he did better with Latinos in exit polls of each of the top 10 battleground states, a POLITICO review of election data found…. Trump improved his showing among Latinos by scaling back some of his immigration rhetoric and engaging in a sustained bilingual social media and TV ad campaign that courted Latinos based on place of origin, gender and religion. But, in interviews with more than a dozen experts on Hispanic voters in six states, no factor was as salient as Trump’s blue-collar appeal for Latinos. ‘Most Latinos identify first as working-class Americans, and Trump spoke to that,’ said Josh Zaragoza, a top Democratic data specialist in Arizona, adding that Hispanic men in particular ‘are very entrepreneurial. Their economic language is more aligned with the way Republicans speak: pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, owning your own business.'” • You’d think that liberal Democrats would dial back teh racism, but based on past performance, they’ll double down.

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

* * *

Shipping: “Reefer capacity tapped out prior to vaccine release” [Freight Waves]. “The national reefer — industry slang for temperature-controlled trailers — rejection index (ROTRI) topped 48% for the first time since the index’s creation this week, which could move even higher once the vaccine for COVID-19 begins being distributed in the coming months. This means that shippers that utilize temperature-controlled equipment should be prepared to continue paying premiums for this service for the foreseeable future… While the tight capacity may not be a direct concern for vaccine distribution efforts, it should be for shippers that move freight on temperature-controlled equipment. The vaccine will be largely moved on smaller equipment than the 53-foot trailers that the reefer rejection index measures, but that also means fewer alternatives for shippers who rely on that distribution channel. Transportation providers know vaccine distribution is the highest priority and they will be well compensated for its transport, which means other commodities will be pushed down the already tall priority ladder . This will also impact dry van capacity as shippers can utilize reefer backhaul lanes at a discount sometimes, meaning some of them will lose their providers if they already haven’t.” • Pelosi better stock up on ice cream.

Shipping: “Opinion: Australia’s New Crew Change Policy is Neat, Plausible… And Wrong” [gCaptain]. • See NC on crew change policy here. Normally, I’m not a fan of arguments against “the heavy hand of regulation” and so forth. But in this case, it does seem that Australia’s getting it wrong. “However, that does not change the fact that within the last month, there have been three consecutive sets of legal rules governing crew changes in Western Australia. How, therefore, can it sensibly be said that shipping companies can “adjust” and “develop new plans for seafarer repatriation” under such impossible circumstances and such fast-changing rules?”

Commodities: “‘Very stressful’: COVID-19 surge slices U.S. demand for big Thanksgiving turkeys” [Reuters]. “[A]s surging COVID-19 cases prompted U.S. cities and states to urge Americans to stay home just weeks before the holiday, customers swapped out orders for whole birds for smaller turkey breasts. As a last-minute shift toward small-scale celebrations upends demand for the star of Thanksgiving tables, turkey producers and retailers are scrambling to fill orders for lightweight birds and partial cuts…. Suppliers need to be nimble as about half of Americans plan to alter or skip traditional festivities due to local health advisories against big gatherings, according to market research firm Nielson. About 70% are planning a Thanksgiving with fewer than six people, compared with 48% last year.”

Commodities: “World’s top surgical glove maker shuts factories due to coronavirus” [Agence France Presse]. “A Malaysian company that is the world’s biggest manufacturer of surgical gloves will close over half of its factories [28] after a surge in coronavirus cases among workers, authorities said Monday…. here has been a cluster of virus outbreaks among Top Glove employees — many of whom are low-paid migrant workers — at factories in an industrial area near the capital, Kuala Lumpur. More than 1,000 cases were recorded Monday, prompting the government to order the plants to close.” • 28 factories!

Debt: “America’s Zombie Companies Have Racked Up $1.4 Trillion of Debt” [Bloomberg]. “From Boeing Co., Carnival Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. to Exxon Mobil Corp. and Macy’s Inc., many of the nation’s most iconic companies aren’t earning enough to cover their interest expenses (a key criterion, as most market experts define it, for zombie status). Almost 200 corporations have joined the ranks of so-called zombie firms since the onset of the pandemic, according to a Bloomberg analysis of financial data from 3,000 of the country’s largest publicly-traded companies. In fact, zombies now account for nearly 20% of those firms. Even more stark, they’ve added almost $1 trillion of debt to their balance sheets in the span, bringing total obligations to $1.36 trillion. That’s more than double the roughly $500 billion zombie companies owed at the peak of the financial crisis.”

Manufacturing: “GM to recall 7M vehicles globally to replace Takata air bags” [Associated Press]. “General Motors will recall about 7 million big pickup trucks and SUVs worldwide to replace potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators… Exploding Takata inflators caused the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 63 million inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that as of September, more than 11.1 million had not been fixed. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. Takata used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to fill air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to heat and humidity, and they can explode with too much pressure, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. Twenty-seven people have been killed worldwide by the exploding inflators, including 18 in the U.S.” • Cost: “An estimated $1.2 billion, about one third of its net income so far this year.”

Capital: “Wealthy Europeans Join SPAC Club in Record Year for Listings” [Bloomberg]. “The allure of blank check companies is spreading beyond the U.S., with a host of European business tycoons now plotting deals. Listing a so-called special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, has been the go-to method for wealthy Americans to raise money for takeovers this year. SPACs have raised more than $60 billion to pursue targets in 2020, a record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. accounts for almost all of that figure. Now, Europeans are joining the hunt.” • Private equity just wasn’t predatory enough, I guess.

The Biosphere

“Organized crime in the fisheries sector threatens a sustainable ocean economy” [Nature]. “Here we present the current state of knowledge on organized crime in the fisheries sector. We show how the many facets of organized crime in this sector, including fraud, drug trafficking and forced labour, hinder progress towards the development of a sustainable ocean economy. With reference to worldwide promising practices, we highlight practical opportunities for action to address the problem. We emphasize the need for a shared understanding of the challenge and for the implementation of intelligence-led, skills-based cooperative law enforcement action at a global level and a community-based approach for targeting organized crime in the supply chain of organized criminal networks at a local level, facilitated by legislative frameworks and increased transparency.”

Health Care

“Thanksgiving Harm-Reduction Steps for Those Who Will Travel or Gather Anyway” [Zeynep Tufecki, Insight]. “I love virologist Ian Mackay’s conceptualization of the swiss cheese defense against the pandemic. The more layers, the better. Some layers are shared responsibilities, some are personal. The more we can all do, the better everyone—not just ourselves—will be protected.” • Here is the Swiss Cheese:

And some methods:

Even within a household, virus transmission is not inevitable. There are examples where people in the same household as a symptomatic person never get infected. Wear masks, especially indoors. Consider wearing them outdoors as well—especially if there is anyone high-risk in the group. Sit outside as much as possible. Hang out around a fire pit. Open windows as much as possible. Use a HEPA filter and run it at its highest setting. Continue to socially distance, especially indoors. Sanitize high-touch surfaces, especially if they are non-porous, like stainless steel fridge doors and door knobs. There’s increasing evidence that humidity helps lower transmission. Keeping the house at 40-60% relative humidity is great, not just for this coronavirus but other viruses as well. Also, too much humidity can encourage mold growth.This virus may also survive better at high-humidity, as its reaction appears to be U-shaped. Purchase a humidity reader (available for less than $10) and keep the house at mid-range humidity levels. Finally, give the best masks to high-risk people: the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, and the immuno-compromised.

Finally, some practical suggestions on ventilation as opposed to shaming and fingerwagging! (My only question would be whether it would be useful to add a fan to the mix, no matter the climate. I think moving air is best, for the dilution factor. Readers?)

“Why Oxford’s positive COVID vaccine results are puzzling scientists” [Nature]. “But the [Oxford/AstraZeneca] analysis found a striking difference in efficacy, depending on the amount of vaccine delivered to a participant. A regimen consisting of two full doses given a month apart looked to be just 62% effective. But, surprisingly, participants who received a lower amount of the vaccine in a first dose and then the full amount in the second dose were 90% less likely to develop COVID, compared with participants in the placebo arm… A top priority for researchers is understanding why the vaccine seems to have performed so much better with a lower first dose. One explanation could lie in the data: the trial might not have been big enough to gauge the difference between the two regimens, and the differences will vanish once more cases of COVID-19 are detected…. Another potential explanation is the immune system’s response against the chimpanzee virus. The vaccine triggers an immune response not only to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but also to components of the viral vector. It’s possible that the full first dose blunted this reaction, says Ewer. She plans to look at antibody responses against the chimpanzee virus to help address this question.”

UPDATE “Session A01: Mini-Symposium: Fluid Mechanics of Infectious Diseases” [William D. Ristenpart, Bulletin of the American Physical Society]. Abstract for a conference paper: “Much attention has focused on the role of droplets generated by coughing and sneezing for transmitting infectious disease through the air. The relative importance of these expiratory activities to airborne transmission, however, has never been definitively established. Here, we discuss recent experimental evidence implicating two less-considered but potentially significant mechanisms for airborne disease transmission. (1) In people, we demonstrate that the number of micron-scale expiratory particles emitted during vocalization, such as speaking or singing, increases dramatically with loudness, and can greatly exceed those generated by coughing. Theoretical calculations suggest that vocalizing less often and more quietly yields substantial decreases in transmission probability. (2) In guinea pig experiments, we establish that influenza is transmitted via “aerosolized fomites,” which are virus-contaminated dust particulates released from the fur and cage environment of the animals, not from their expiration. We further establish that aerosolized fomites can be emitted from sources widely used by people, such as paper tissues. Our results suggest that researchers should expand their focus beyond coughing and sneezing as the presumed mechanism for airborne disease transmission.”

“Can dogs smell COVID? Here’s what the science says” [Science]. “Groups need to boost their sample sizes before the wider scientific community can evaluate how useful the dogs might be, agrees James Logan, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who is training and studying COVID-19 dogs… ‘It’s important not to go out too early with grand claims and small data sets,’ he says.” • Well, at least sniffer dogs have made their way into the pages of Nature. And there are several studies underway.

“George Clooney apparently gave his 14 closest friends a million dollars and people are speechless” [Independent]. “[Clooney told GQ] he wanted to share his wealth with his friends, saying: ‘I thought, what I do have are these guys who’ve all, over a period of 35 years, helped me in one way or another. I’ve slept on their couches when I was broke.'” • I dunno. This would seem to throw those relations a little out of whack.

Class Warfare

“Blood, Breastmilk, and Dirt: Silvia Federici and Feminist Materialism in International Law” [The Hampton Institute]. “In this post, I argue that Federici’s work offers a rich resource for redressing the conspicuous absence of a gendered perspective within academic scholarship on materialist approaches to international law. Materialist analyses of systematic inequalities within the international legal field are as relevant now as they ever were, yet the sidelining of gender and feminism within both traditional and new materialism has long been cause for concern. A gendered materialism in international law, which casts light on the logic of capitalist socialization and which affords the social reproductive sphere equal analytical status, allows us to access a clearer picture of the links between global and local exploitation at the intersections of gender, race, and nationality, and provides new conceptual tools to understand the emergence and function of international legal mechanisms as strategies of dominance, expansion, and accumulation.” • I grant this is the sort of post you will like, if you like this sort of post, but it’s a very lucid history of the tortured relations between Marxism and feminism. Also, Silvia Federici is great (see NC here).

“The Revenge of the Yankees” [Michael Lind, Tablet]. “The New Deal revolution of the 1930s is badly misunderstood, both politically and culturally, when it is treated as a left-wing rebellion against right-wing capitalism. Fundamentally it represented the partial overthrow of Yankee Protestant hegemony in American society by a coalition of outsiders, chiefly provincial Southern and Western whites and European-American immigrants in the North, many of them Catholic…. To break this neocolonial pattern of Northeastern economic domination, New Deal Democrats used federal state capitalism to industrialize and modernize the Southern and Western periphery, by means of rural electrification cooperatives, the Tennessee Valley Authority and other hydropower projects, defense production plants assigned to the South and West during World War II, and the interstate highway system (a favorite project of FDR which was only enacted under Eisenhower). In short, Southern and Western politicians and their Northern white ethnic allies who dominated the federal government in the New Deal era deployed federal state capitalism to do an end run around unsympathetic Yankee capitalists, not to advance toward socialism or social democracy.” • This is a fun read, and if you believe history is made by elites, you may even find it persuasive. And speaking of elites–

“Race Consciousness: Fascism and Frank Herbert’s ‘Dune'” [Los Angeles Review of Books]. “Dune was initially received as a countercultural parable warning against ecological devastation and autocratic rule, but geek fascists see the novel as a blueprint for the future…. In the fascist reading of the novel, space colonization has scattered the human species, but what Herbert calls a “race consciousness” moves them to unite under Paul, who sweeps away all opposition in a jihad that kills 60,000,000,000. For the alt-right, Paul stands as the ideal of a sovereign ruler who violently overthrows a decadent regime to bring together “Europid” peoples into a single imperium or ethnostate. Dune ranks as one of Richard Spencer’s favorite novels; although Spencer styles himself as a prep these days, he got his start in geek culture…. Beyond a shared affinity for space-age aristocrats, Faye and Herbert see the sovereign as one who is capable of disciplined foresight. Drawing on the Austrian School economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, many thinkers on the alt-right believe that only men from genetically superior populations are capable of delaying gratification and working toward long-term goals. ” Fortunately for us all, that’s a terrible reading of Herbert’s novel: “Herbert’s book is often deeply conservative, but by the fascists’ own admission it presents a syncretic vision of the future in which cultures and populations have clearly intermingled over time. Paul’s army of desert guerillas, the Fremen, clearly owe something to Arabic and Islamic cultures, and Paul’s own genealogy defies the fascist demand for racial purity. The alt-right has tried to wrestle Islamophobic and Antisemitic messages from the book but they are stymied by its refusal to map existing ethnic categories onto the characters. Fascist commentators also overlook that their long-awaited sovereign Paul begins the series as a tragic character but ends it as a grotesque one. Herbert himself saw the series as a critique of authoritarianism demonstrating for his readers that ‘superheroes are disastrous for humankind.'” •

Bird Song of the Day

I hope that white noise in the background is the sea…

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Case count by United States region:

There’s a drawing back from the vertical, perhaps somehow related to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.

To break it down a little, here’s the Midwest:

Certainly an improvement in the Dakotas, and elsewhere.

Test positivity by region:

Positivity (blue) seems to have plateaued in the Midwest. Still the giant drop in the South (green). Nowhere near 3%, though.

Hospitalization by region:

Hospitalization seems to have plateaued in the South. Nearly.

Case fatality rate by region:

Deaths (purple dotted) heading toward vertical, as they will for until the surge in cases works its way through the pipeline (ugh, what a way to think, it’s like being a World War One general).

CA: “S.F. was flattening the curve — until our urge to gather spiked it. Now we need to reverse the surge” [San Francisco Chronicle]. “In early October, just 27 people a day tested positive in the city, which sat in the state’s yellow tier, meaning the virus risk was “minimal.” That allowed the city to open restaurants for indoor dining at 25% capacity and loosen other restrictions. But a few weeks can bring a dramatic change of fate — especially in the miserable year that is 2020. Now, San Francisco sits in the red tier, meaning the virus spread is “substantial,” and 105 people in the city receive a positive test result every day. … So what happened? Despite the city’s repeated insistence on following data, science and facts, we don’t have the data, science or facts to identify the exact problem spots. The city’s contact tracing system isn’t good enough to pinpoint specific events, gatherings, businesses or other places that are fueling the surge…. Jon Jacobo, a co-chair of the Latino Task Force, helps run a weekly test site in the Mission and said it’s clear indoor dining and casual gatherings led to a rise in cases. He said the fact that the health department allowed indoor dining — without masks as people ate and drank — led some people to assume it was safe to have friends and family over for dinner in their own homes without masks.”

NY: “Secret plans helped Brooklyn synagogue pull off massive, maskless wedding” [New York Post]. “A Hasidic synagogue in Brooklyn planned the wedding of a chief rabbi’s grandson with such secrecy, it was able to host thousands of maskless celebrants without the city catching on. Despite a surge in COVID-19 cases, guests crammed shoulder to shoulder inside the Yetev Lev temple in Williamsburg for the Nov. 8 nuptials — stomping, dancing and singing at the top of their lungs without a mask in sight, videos obtained by The Post show… ‘In recent weeks, organizers worked tirelessly to arrange everything in the best way possible. All notices about upcoming celebrations were passed along through word of mouth, with no notices in writing, no posters on the synagogue walls, no invitations sent through the mail, nor even a report in any publication, including this very newspaper,’ [according to Der Blatt].” • Behavior not peculiar to the Hasidim, I might add.

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord

“Sidney Powell Not Part of Trump’s Legal Team, Says Rudy Giuliani” [WSJ]. • That was fast. Woo woo. “In Election Litigation, An Ominous Sign” [Washington Monthly]. “One of their arguments was that the state court had violated the U.S. Constitution by applying the Pennsylvania Constitution at all. This, they said, violated the ‘elections clause,’ Article I § 4, which provides that ‘[t]he times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the Legislature thereof’ unless Congress passes a law governing those things. Here’s the core of the argument: the provision, they argued, says, ‘legislatures.’ It does not say ‘legislatures and state courts.’ It does not say ‘legislatures, state courts, and state constitutions.’ …. Read that way, the U.S. Constitution, which supersedes any state law or constitution, gives the state legislatures a federal function ‘independent’ of its function in the state. So, Republicans argued, the people of the state could not guarantee themselves a right to vote in federal elections, whatever they might put in their state constitution…. This is the “independent state legislature doctrine.'” • I don’t know who invented the “independent state legislature doctrine.” My guess would be John C. Calhoun. He’s right (1):

Trump has got liberals worshipping the integrity of insecure electronic voting machines. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) November 20, 2020

“The Memo: Trump plows ahead with efforts to overturn election” [The Hill]. “An Economist/YouGov poll conducted earlier this week found that 84 percent of Republican voters do not believe Biden’s election victory to be legitimate. Such a high number is a major problem, given that democracies only function when there is a widespread consensus on such basic facts as the outcome of elections.” • I don’t recall a similar poll being done back when the Steele Dossier was going to be a thing….

This is a good thread on being an election observer:

Biden Transition

UPDATE “The National Security Revolving Door Starts Spinning” [David Sirota, Daily Poster]. “On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Biden has chosen his longtime aide, Tony Blinken, to serve as Secretary of State and will name Jake Sullivan, his senior advisor and a former Hillary Clinton aide, national security adviser. Former Obama Defense Department official Michèle Flournoy is considered the favorite to be Secretary of Defense. After leaving the Obama administration, Blinken and Flournoy founded WestExec Advisors, a secretive consulting firm whose motto has been: “Bringing the Situation Room to the board room.” Flournoy and Sullivan have both held roles at think tanks raking in money from defense contractors and U.S. government intelligence and defense agencies. Last week, two board members from Raytheon joined a small group to brief President-elect Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on national security issues. One of the two Raytheon board members, Robert Work, has also worked for WestExec.” • See, children? Blinken is fine: A secretary of state who cares about refugees….

After all, Biden’s Secretary of State could have been Pete Buttigieg (“He speaks thirty-two languages!”). Or Hillary Clinton. And then there’s Jake Sullivan: Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was one of the key people in the group formed by CIA, Dems & neocons — including (of course) Bill Kristol, Mike Chertoff, Mike Morell, Mike Rogers, Podesta, etc. — urging more belligerence toward Moscowhttps://t.co/iKjKyJc0Xy — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 23, 2020 “Biden’s COVID Plan Is Better Than Trump’s, But Still Far From Sufficient” [Truthout]. “Indeed, a particular brand of science underlies the plan, setting the needs of the donor class ahead of stopping the COVID outbreak in any rapid order. The plan, for one, calls for hiring 100,000 Americans as part of a Public Health Job Corps to aid in contact tracing. That certainly sounds like a lot, but isn’t nearly enough by an order of magnitude…. The Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity at George Washington University offers a county-level U.S. map of estimates of the number of contact-trace workers needed based on population size, tracer workforce and the present outbreak load. Even under heroic assumptions as to what contact tracers can accomplish daily, the projected personnel needed exceeds the Biden plan’s capacity. For example, the metropolitan regions of Minneapolis and St. Paul alone would need 6,000 of those 100,000 tracers the Biden transition team proposes, hardly anywhere near what is necessary to control the outbreak, even combined with the measly efforts by the states so far. Of course, contact tracing depends on a lot more than infections and workforce. As ProPublica describes, counties with meatpacking-driven outbreaks are having great difficulty tracking cases among immigrants, many of whom speak other languages, don’t have phones or don’t want contact with state officials for reasons of immigration status under Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. So why the numbers gap between infections and Biden’s contact tracers? The political class here simply can’t afford the possibility that U.S. governance in late empire, focused on corporations and the stock market first, suddenly would be centered on hiring the American people to help the American people. FDR bunting is being placed on an austerity parade float.” • If Biden only jumps halfway across the abyss, it doesn’t really matter that Trump jumped only one-quarter of the way.

2020

Biden (D)(1): “House of Cards” [Mother Jones (nippersmom)]. “But the most controversial item on the banks’ agenda, and the one that would require the most legwork from Biden, was bankruptcy reform…. A 2008 study published in the American Bankruptcy Law Journal found that “credit card companies saved billions because of reduced loan loss rates,” but that none of those savings benefited consumers. Because interest rates and late fees continued to tick upward, ‘the cost to credit card customers increased 5% to 17%.’ And even before the recession hit, Credit Suisse found that the bankruptcy law had ‘a profound impact on subprime borrowers’ and made it more likely that borrowers would fail on their bankruptcy payment plans. ‘Before that law was passed you could file a chapter 7 bankruptcy for seven, eight, nine-hundred dollars, including attorney’s fees and filing fees, and that’s gone up to more like $2,000,’ Sommer said. “It’s made bankruptcy much more expensive, difficult, burdensome, and less effective.’ The number of personal bankruptcy filings has fallen by half in 15 years.” • This is a long and very detailed exposé of the state of Delaware, whiffy out of all proportion to its size, and Biden’s role in servicing the credit card companies and banks located there. It’s worth grabbing a cup of coffee and reading in full, becuase it shows the kind of politics that Biden would regard as successful. Even moral. Biden (D)(2): “The Biden Campaign’s Decision Not To Knock on Doors Was a Huge Mistake” [Jacobin]. “The Biden campaign drastically scaled back on door knockers, ceding ground to Republicans in crucial states. Throughout the summer and fall, Biden staffers and their allies argued the risk of contracting COVID-19 and spreading it to others outweighed whatever gains in-person canvassers could make on the ground.” • But when Sanders had to be forced from the race, in-person voting was encouraged! Trump (R)(1): “Trump ally Stephen Moore: President ‘going to leave the office triumphant'” [The Hill]. “Stephen Moore, an economist and outside adviser to President Trump, said he thinks the president will leave office ‘triumphant,’ pointing to optimistic projections for the economy and noting the announcement that a COVID-19 vaccine could be just weeks away. ‘I think [Trump] is going to leave the office triumphant. … By early next year, we will have a vaccine that nobody thought was possible,’ Moore said during an interview with John Catsimatidis on his radio show on WABC 770 AM that aired Sunday.” • Musical interlude…. * * * “How Biden swung the religious vote” [Politico]. “Between 47 percent and 50 percent of Catholic voters supported Trump — a small decline from 2016, but enough to cost him the Rust Belt states that mattered most to his path to victory. Nationally, the president carried white Catholics by a 15-point margin, according to AP/VoteCast data, marking a significant decline from his 33-point margin of victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Trump’s slippage with white evangelicals was less pronounced — surveys showed him carrying 76 percent to 78 percent of the white, born-again Christian vote — a slight decrease from 2016, when he won support from about 8 in 10 white evangelicals. But it had far-reaching implications for the president in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia, where current vote totals show him losing by less than 1 percent.” FL: “How Hispanic Voters Swung Miami Right” [New York Times]. “[In Miami-Dade] 58 percent of the electorate is Hispanic and Mr. Trump made huge inroads from 2016 to 2020. Hundreds of thousands more people voted for him this year, and though he still lost the county to Joseph R. Biden Jr., he improved his margin over 2016 by 22 percentage points, a swing that helped him easily win Florida and sweep a slew of local Republicans into office. Much has been said about how Latinos in many parts of the country, while still favoring Mr. Biden in large numbers, voted more Republican than in 2016. But South Florida is a unique case study. No other place has quite the same mix of Republican-friendly Hispanics, led by conservative Cuban-Americans. And the Trump presidency has strengthened their hand, forcing Miami to reckon with hard and contradictory truths about immigration, racism and power.” • It seems our strategy of encouraging Latin American oligarchs and regime hard men to immigrate here has had its desired effect, at least in Miami. Though not everywhere– “Culture wars fuel Trump’s blue-collar Latino gains” [Politico]. “Despite four years of being defined as a racist for his rhetoric and harsh immigration policies, Trump improved his margins in 78 of the nation’s 100 majority-Hispanic counties. And he did better with Latinos in exit polls of each of the top 10 battleground states, a POLITICO review of election data found…. Trump improved his showing among Latinos by scaling back some of his immigration rhetoric and engaging in a sustained bilingual social media and TV ad campaign that courted Latinos based on place of origin, gender and religion. But, in interviews with more than a dozen experts on Hispanic voters in six states, no factor was as salient as Trump’s blue-collar appeal for Latinos. ‘Most Latinos identify first as working-class Americans, and Trump spoke to that,’ said Josh Zaragoza, a top Democratic data specialist in Arizona, adding that Hispanic men in particular ‘are very entrepreneurial. Their economic language is more aligned with the way Republicans speak: pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, owning your own business.'” • You’d think that liberal Democrats would dial back teh racism, but based on past performance, they’ll double down.

Obama Legacy

He’s right (2): There's a lot of work going into 10 page memos on why putting poor people into wood chippers is a bad idea, because some of the "Obama people" economists are obsessed with the idea after CBO scored it well. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) November 20, 2020

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

Shipping: “Reefer capacity tapped out prior to vaccine release” [Freight Waves]. “The national reefer — industry slang for temperature-controlled trailers — rejection index (ROTRI) topped 48% for the first time since the index’s creation this week, which could move even higher once the vaccine for COVID-19 begins being distributed in the coming months. This means that shippers that utilize temperature-controlled equipment should be prepared to continue paying premiums for this service for the foreseeable future… While the tight capacity may not be a direct concern for vaccine distribution efforts, it should be for shippers that move freight on temperature-controlled equipment. The vaccine will be largely moved on smaller equipment than the 53-foot trailers that the reefer rejection index measures, but that also means fewer alternatives for shippers who rely on that distribution channel. Transportation providers know vaccine distribution is the highest priority and they will be well compensated for its transport, which means other commodities will be pushed down the already tall priority ladder . This will also impact dry van capacity as shippers can utilize reefer backhaul lanes at a discount sometimes, meaning some of them will lose their providers if they already haven’t.” • Pelosi better stock up on ice cream.

Shipping: “Opinion: Australia’s New Crew Change Policy is Neat, Plausible… And Wrong” [gCaptain]. • See NC on crew change policy here. Normally, I’m not a fan of arguments against “the heavy hand of regulation” and so forth. But in this case, it does seem that Australia’s getting it wrong. “However, that does not change the fact that within the last month, there have been three consecutive sets of legal rules governing crew changes in Western Australia. How, therefore, can it sensibly be said that shipping companies can “adjust” and “develop new plans for seafarer repatriation” under such impossible circumstances and such fast-changing rules?”

Commodities: “‘Very stressful’: COVID-19 surge slices U.S. demand for big Thanksgiving turkeys” [Reuters]. “[A]s surging COVID-19 cases prompted U.S. cities and states to urge Americans to stay home just weeks before the holiday, customers swapped out orders for whole birds for smaller turkey breasts. As a last-minute shift toward small-scale celebrations upends demand for the star of Thanksgiving tables, turkey producers and retailers are scrambling to fill orders for lightweight birds and partial cuts…. Suppliers need to be nimble as about half of Americans plan to alter or skip traditional festivities due to local health advisories against big gatherings, according to market research firm Nielson. About 70% are planning a Thanksgiving with fewer than six people, compared with 48% last year.”

Commodities: “World’s top surgical glove maker shuts factories due to coronavirus” [Agence France Presse]. “A Malaysian company that is the world’s biggest manufacturer of surgical gloves will close over half of its factories [28] after a surge in coronavirus cases among workers, authorities said Monday…. here has been a cluster of virus outbreaks among Top Glove employees — many of whom are low-paid migrant workers — at factories in an industrial area near the capital, Kuala Lumpur. More than 1,000 cases were recorded Monday, prompting the government to order the plants to close.” • 28 factories!

Debt: “America’s Zombie Companies Have Racked Up $1.4 Trillion of Debt” [Bloomberg]. “From Boeing Co., Carnival Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. to Exxon Mobil Corp. and Macy’s Inc., many of the nation’s most iconic companies aren’t earning enough to cover their interest expenses (a key criterion, as most market experts define it, for zombie status). Almost 200 corporations have joined the ranks of so-called zombie firms since the onset of the pandemic, according to a Bloomberg analysis of financial data from 3,000 of the country’s largest publicly-traded companies. In fact, zombies now account for nearly 20% of those firms. Even more stark, they’ve added almost $1 trillion of debt to their balance sheets in the span, bringing total obligations to $1.36 trillion. That’s more than double the roughly $500 billion zombie companies owed at the peak of the financial crisis.”

Manufacturing: “GM to recall 7M vehicles globally to replace Takata air bags” [Associated Press]. “General Motors will recall about 7 million big pickup trucks and SUVs worldwide to replace potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators… Exploding Takata inflators caused the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 63 million inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that as of September, more than 11.1 million had not been fixed. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. Takata used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to fill air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to heat and humidity, and they can explode with too much pressure, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel. Twenty-seven people have been killed worldwide by the exploding inflators, including 18 in the U.S.” • Cost: “An estimated $1.2 billion, about one third of its net income so far this year.”

Capital: “Wealthy Europeans Join SPAC Club in Record Year for Listings” [Bloomberg]. “The allure of blank check companies is spreading beyond the U.S., with a host of European business tycoons now plotting deals. Listing a so-called special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, has been the go-to method for wealthy Americans to raise money for takeovers this year. SPACs have raised more than $60 billion to pursue targets in 2020, a record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. accounts for almost all of that figure. Now, Europeans are joining the hunt.” • Private equity just wasn’t predatory enough, I guess.

Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 72 Greed (previous close: 63 Greed) [CNN]. One week ago: 69 (Greed). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 23 at 12:28pm.

Rapture Index: Closes unchanged [Rapture Ready]. Record High, October 10, 2016: 189. Current: 182. (Remember that bringing on the rapture is a good thing, so high is better.) I would have expected “Beast Government” to be popping with Biden’s election.

The Biosphere

“Organized crime in the fisheries sector threatens a sustainable ocean economy” [Nature]. “Here we present the current state of knowledge on organized crime in the fisheries sector. We show how the many facets of organized crime in this sector, including fraud, drug trafficking and forced labour, hinder progress towards the development of a sustainable ocean economy. With reference to worldwide promising practices, we highlight practical opportunities for action to address the problem. We emphasize the need for a shared understanding of the challenge and for the implementation of intelligence-led, skills-based cooperative law enforcement action at a global level and a community-based approach for targeting organized crime in the supply chain of organized criminal networks at a local level, facilitated by legislative frameworks and increased transparency.”

Health Care

“Thanksgiving Harm-Reduction Steps for Those Who Will Travel or Gather Anyway” [Zeynep Tufecki, Insight]. “I love virologist Ian Mackay’s conceptualization of the swiss cheese defense against the pandemic. The more layers, the better. Some layers are shared responsibilities, some are personal. The more we can all do, the better everyone—not just ourselves—will be protected.” • Here is the Swiss Cheese:

And some methods:

Even within a household, virus transmission is not inevitable. There are examples where people in the same household as a symptomatic person never get infected. Wear masks, especially indoors. Consider wearing them outdoors as well—especially if there is anyone high-risk in the group. Sit outside as much as possible. Hang out around a fire pit. Open windows as much as possible. Use a HEPA filter and run it at its highest setting. Continue to socially distance, especially indoors. Sanitize high-touch surfaces, especially if they are non-porous, like stainless steel fridge doors and door knobs. There’s increasing evidence that humidity helps lower transmission. Keeping the house at 40-60% relative humidity is great, not just for this coronavirus but other viruses as well. Also, too much humidity can encourage mold growth.This virus may also survive better at high-humidity, as its reaction appears to be U-shaped. Purchase a humidity reader (available for less than $10) and keep the house at mid-range humidity levels. Finally, give the best masks to high-risk people: the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, and the immuno-compromised.

Finally, some practical suggestions on ventilation as opposed to shaming and fingerwagging! (My only question would be whether it would be useful to add a fan to the mix, no matter the climate. I think moving air is best, for the dilution factor. Readers?)

“Why Oxford’s positive COVID vaccine results are puzzling scientists” [Nature]. “But the [Oxford/AstraZeneca] analysis found a striking difference in efficacy, depending on the amount of vaccine delivered to a participant. A regimen consisting of two full doses given a month apart looked to be just 62% effective. But, surprisingly, participants who received a lower amount of the vaccine in a first dose and then the full amount in the second dose were 90% less likely to develop COVID, compared with participants in the placebo arm… A top priority for researchers is understanding why the vaccine seems to have performed so much better with a lower first dose. One explanation could lie in the data: the trial might not have been big enough to gauge the difference between the two regimens, and the differences will vanish once more cases of COVID-19 are detected…. Another potential explanation is the immune system’s response against the chimpanzee virus. The vaccine triggers an immune response not only to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but also to components of the viral vector. It’s possible that the full first dose blunted this reaction, says Ewer. She plans to look at antibody responses against the chimpanzee virus to help address this question.”

UPDATE “Session A01: Mini-Symposium: Fluid Mechanics of Infectious Diseases” [William D. Ristenpart, Bulletin of the American Physical Society]. Abstract for a conference paper: “Much attention has focused on the role of droplets generated by coughing and sneezing for transmitting infectious disease through the air. The relative importance of these expiratory activities to airborne transmission, however, has never been definitively established. Here, we discuss recent experimental evidence implicating two less-considered but potentially significant mechanisms for airborne disease transmission. (1) In people, we demonstrate that the number of micron-scale expiratory particles emitted during vocalization, such as speaking or singing, increases dramatically with loudness, and can greatly exceed those generated by coughing. Theoretical calculations suggest that vocalizing less often and more quietly yields substantial decreases in transmission probability. (2) In guinea pig experiments, we establish that influenza is transmitted via “aerosolized fomites,” which are virus-contaminated dust particulates released from the fur and cage environment of the animals, not from their expiration. We further establish that aerosolized fomites can be emitted from sources widely used by people, such as paper tissues. Our results suggest that researchers should expand their focus beyond coughing and sneezing as the presumed mechanism for airborne disease transmission.”

“Can dogs smell COVID? Here’s what the science says” [Science]. “Groups need to boost their sample sizes before the wider scientific community can evaluate how useful the dogs might be, agrees James Logan, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who is training and studying COVID-19 dogs… ‘It’s important not to go out too early with grand claims and small data sets,’ he says.” • Well, at least sniffer dogs have made their way into the pages of Nature. And there are several studies underway.

“George Clooney apparently gave his 14 closest friends a million dollars and people are speechless” [Independent]. “[Clooney told GQ] he wanted to share his wealth with his friends, saying: ‘I thought, what I do have are these guys who’ve all, over a period of 35 years, helped me in one way or another. I’ve slept on their couches when I was broke.'” • I dunno. This would seem to throw those relations a little out of whack.

Class Warfare

“Blood, Breastmilk, and Dirt: Silvia Federici and Feminist Materialism in International Law” [The Hampton Institute]. “In this post, I argue that Federici’s work offers a rich resource for redressing the conspicuous absence of a gendered perspective within academic scholarship on materialist approaches to international law. Materialist analyses of systematic inequalities within the international legal field are as relevant now as they ever were, yet the sidelining of gender and feminism within both traditional and new materialism has long been cause for concern. A gendered materialism in international law, which casts light on the logic of capitalist socialization and which affords the social reproductive sphere equal analytical status, allows us to access a clearer picture of the links between global and local exploitation at the intersections of gender, race, and nationality, and provides new conceptual tools to understand the emergence and function of international legal mechanisms as strategies of dominance, expansion, and accumulation.” • I grant this is the sort of post you will like, if you like this sort of post, but it’s a very lucid history of the tortured relations between Marxism and feminism. Also, Silvia Federici is great (see NC here).

One way to nuke meritocracy, or at least inherited meritocracy, which is what we have today with legacy adminssion and other class advantages:

“The Revenge of the Yankees” [Michael Lind, Tablet]. “The New Deal revolution of the 1930s is badly misunderstood, both politically and culturally, when it is treated as a left-wing rebellion against right-wing capitalism. Fundamentally it represented the partial overthrow of Yankee Protestant hegemony in American society by a coalition of outsiders, chiefly provincial Southern and Western whites and European-American immigrants in the North, many of them Catholic…. To break this neocolonial pattern of Northeastern economic domination, New Deal Democrats used federal state capitalism to industrialize and modernize the Southern and Western periphery, by means of rural electrification cooperatives, the Tennessee Valley Authority and other hydropower projects, defense production plants assigned to the South and West during World War II, and the interstate highway system (a favorite project of FDR which was only enacted under Eisenhower). In short, Southern and Western politicians and their Northern white ethnic allies who dominated the federal government in the New Deal era deployed federal state capitalism to do an end run around unsympathetic Yankee capitalists, not to advance toward socialism or social democracy.” • This is a fun read, and if you believe history is made by elites, you may even find it persuasive. And speaking of elites–

“Race Consciousness: Fascism and Frank Herbert’s ‘Dune'” [Los Angeles Review of Books]. “Dune was initially received as a countercultural parable warning against ecological devastation and autocratic rule, but geek fascists see the novel as a blueprint for the future…. In the fascist reading of the novel, space colonization has scattered the human species, but what Herbert calls a “race consciousness” moves them to unite under Paul, who sweeps away all opposition in a jihad that kills 60,000,000,000. For the alt-right, Paul stands as the ideal of a sovereign ruler who violently overthrows a decadent regime to bring together “Europid” peoples into a single imperium or ethnostate. Dune ranks as one of Richard Spencer’s favorite novels; although Spencer styles himself as a prep these days, he got his start in geek culture…. Beyond a shared affinity for space-age aristocrats, Faye and Herbert see the sovereign as one who is capable of disciplined foresight. Drawing on the Austrian School economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, many thinkers on the alt-right believe that only men from genetically superior populations are capable of delaying gratification and working toward long-term goals. ” Fortunately for us all, that’s a terrible reading of Herbert’s novel: “Herbert’s book is often deeply conservative, but by the fascists’ own admission it presents a syncretic vision of the future in which cultures and populations have clearly intermingled over time. Paul’s army of desert guerillas, the Fremen, clearly owe something to Arabic and Islamic cultures, and Paul’s own genealogy defies the fascist demand for racial purity. The alt-right has tried to wrestle Islamophobic and Antisemitic messages from the book but they are stymied by its refusal to map existing ethnic categories onto the characters. Fascist commentators also overlook that their long-awaited sovereign Paul begins the series as a tragic character but ends it as a grotesque one. Herbert himself saw the series as a critique of authoritarianism demonstrating for his readers that ‘superheroes are disastrous for humankind.'” •

Obsolete iPads could be affordable personal computers and useful for project builds.

Oxford University coronavirus vaccine up to 90% effectiveThe University of Oxford announced Monday a COVID-19 vaccine it's developed with AstraZeneca is 70.4% effective in preventing people from developing symptoms.Of note: The effectiveness of the vaccine increased to 90% among volunteers given half a dose, follow…The University of Oxford announced Monday that a COVID-19 vaccine it's developed with AstraZeneca is 70.4% effective in preventing people from developing symptoms, per interim data from Phase 3 trials.

Why it matters: The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is shown to work in different age groups and can be stored at fridge temperature. It is much cheaper than other vaccines in development and is part of the global COVAX initiative, designed to ensure doses go where they're most needed.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement that the vaccine's "simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval."

Between the lines: The findings come from combining results from two different dosing regimes.

When two full doses were given to volunteers at least a month apart, the efficacy was 62%. This rose to 90% among those given half a dose, followed by a full one, the university noted in a statement.

Pfizer and Moderna both reported earlier this month their coronavirus vaccines had efficacy rates of about 95%.

Yes, but: The Food and Drug Administration initially set the bar for a COVID-19 vaccine to be 50% effective, roughly in line with the seasonal flu vaccine. A 70% efficacy was a best-case scenario back then, per Axios' Marisa Fernandez.

For the record: More than 24,000 volunteers were involved in the trials in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa — including 131 coronavirus cases, per the university.

There were no hospitalizations nor severe cases of COVID-19 reported from participants treated with the vaccine.

What to expect: The university said in a statement scientists are "hoping to supply 3 billion doses of the vaccine and make it available to people around the world by the end of next year."

Structural basis for potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and role of antibody affinity maturationCurrently there is neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment strategy available for COVID19. Here, Hurlburt et al. provide the crystal structure of a patient-derived monoclonal antibody neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 via shedding of the S1 subunit and competing f…Recombinant protein expression and purification

The plasmid encoding the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GenBank: MN908947), residues 319–591, were cloned upstream of a C-terminal HRV3C cleavage site, a monomeric Fc-tag, and an 8×His-tag5, and was a gift from Dr. Jason McLellan.

One liter of 293SGlycoDelete cells21 were cultured to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transiently transfected with 500 μg of pαH-RBD-Fc using 2 mg of polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences, catalog number 24765). Cultural supernatant was collected 6 days post transfection by centrifugation and sterile filtered using a 0.22 μm vacuum filter. The RBD was purified using protein A agarose resin (GoldBio, catalog number P-400) and cleaving the Fc domain using HRV3C protease (made in house) on-column. The eluate containing the RBD was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated in 2 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl. Protein was aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C until needed.

Five hundred milliliters of 293-6E cells (National Research Council of Canada (under license)) were cultured to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transiently transfected with 125 μg each of CV30 Heavy and Kappa chains using 1 mg of PEI. Cultural supernatant was collected 6 days post transfection by centrifugation and sterile filtered using a 0.22 μm vacuum filter. IgG was purified using protein A agarose resin and eluted using Pierce IgG Elution Buffer (Thermo Scientific, catalog number 21004). Eluate was pH adjusted to 7.5 using 1 M HEPES pH 7.5. IgG was further purified by SEC using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column. Antigen binding fragment (Fab) was generated by incubating IgG with LysC (New England Biolabs, catalog number P8109S) at a ratio of 1 μg LysC per 10 mg IgG at 37 °C for 18 h. Fab unexpectedly stuck to protein A resin and was eluted as mixture of Fab, undigested IgG, and digested Fc product using the IgG elution buffer. Fab and Fc product was purified by SEC. The CV30 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex was obtained my mixing Fab and Fc product with a twofold molar excess of RBD and incubated for 90 min at room temperature with nutation followed by SEC. The complex was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.

Crystal screening and structure determination

The complex was concentrated to 10 mg/mL for initial crystal screening by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion in the MCSG Crystallization Suite (Anatrace, MCSG-1, MCSG-2, and MCSG-3) using a NT8 drop setter (Formulatrix). Diffracting crystals were obtained in a mother liquor (ML) containing 0.2 M (NH 4 ) Citrate, tribasic pH 7.0 and 12% (w/v) PEG 3350. The crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in ML supplemented with 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source SBC 19-ID at a 12.662 keV. The data set was processed using XDS22 and data reduction was performed using AIMLESS in CCP4 to a resolution of 2.75 Å. The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser23 in Phenix24 with a search model of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDBid: 6LZG)9 and the Fab structure (PDBid: 5I1E)25 divided into Fv and Fc portions. Remaining model building was completed using COOT26 and refinement was performed in Phenix24. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Structural figures were made in PyMol (Schrodinger, LLC).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Immulon 2HB microtiter plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 50 ng/well of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed 4X with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.02% Tween-20 (wash buffer). Plates were blocked with 250 μL of 10% non-fat milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing 4× with wash buffer, purified IgG was added at an initial concentration of 20 μg/mL and diluted in tenfold serial dilutions in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed 4× in wash buffer and the secondary antibody Goat anti-Human Ig-HRP (Southern Biotech, catalog number 2010-05) was added at a 1 : 3000 dilution and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After a final 4× wash, 50 μL of SureBlue Reserve TMB Peroxidase Substrate (SeraCare, catalog number 5120-0081) was added and incubated for 4 min followed by addition of 100 μL of 1 N H 2 SO 4 to stop the reaction. The optical density at 450 nm was measured using a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). All wash steps were performed using a BioTek 405 Select Microplate Washer.

Biolayer interferometry

For kinetic analyses glCV30 was captured on anti-Human IgG Fc capture (AHC) sensors (ForteBio, catalog number 18-5064) at a concentration of 20 μg/mL and loaded for 100 s. After loading, the baseline signal was then recorded for 1 min in KB. The sensors were immersed into wells containing serial dilutions of purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD in KB for 150 s (association phase), followed by immersion in KB for an additional 600 s (dissociation phase). The background signal from each analyte-containing well was measured using VRC01 IgG control reference sensors and subtracted from the signal obtained with each corresponding glCV30 loaded sensor. Kinetic analyses were performed at least twice with an independently prepared analyte dilution series. Curve fitting was performed using a 1 : 1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. Mean k on , k off values were determined by averaging all binding curves that matched the theoretical fit with an R2 value of ≥0.98.

Pseudovirus neutralization assay

HIV-1-derived viral particles were pseudotyped with full-length wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S 27. Briefly, plasmids expressing the HIV-1 Gag and pol (pHDM540 Hgpm2), HIV-1Rev (pRC-CMV-rev1b), HIV-1 Tat (pHDM-tat1b), the SARS-CoV-2 spike (pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike) and a luciferase/GFP reporter (pHAGE-CMV-Luc2-IRES542 ZsGreen-W) were co-transfected into HEK293T (ATCC, catalog number CRL-3216) cells at a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1.6 : 4.6 ratio using 293 Free transfection reagent (EMD Millipore, catalog number 72181) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pseudovirus production was carried out at 32 °C for 72 h after which the culture supernatant was harvested, clarified by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C.

HEK293T cells stably expressing hACE2 (BEI Resources, catalog number NR-5251) were seeded at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well in a 100 µL volume in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. The next day, CV30 and glCV30 were serially diluted (three fold) starting at 50 μg/mL in 30 µL of cDMEM in 96-well round-bottom 27 plates in duplicate or quadruplicate. An equal volume of viral supernatant diluted to result in 2 × 105 luciferase units was added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Meanwhile 50 μL of cDMEM containing 6 µg/mL polybrene was added to each well of 293T-ACE2 cells (2 µg/mL final concentration) and incubated for 30 min. The media was aspirated from 293T-ACE2 cells and 100 µL of the virus-antibody mixture was added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The supernatant was aspirated and replaced with 100 μL of Steadyglo luciferase reagent (Promega). 75 µL was then transferred to an opaque, white bottom plate and read on a Fluorskan Ascent Fluorimeter. Control wells containing virus but no antibody (cells + virus) and no virus or antibody (cells only) were included on each plate.

Percent neutralization for each well was calculated as the relative light units (RLU) of the average of the cells + virus wells, minus test wells (cells + mAb + virus), and dividing this result difference by the average RLU between virus control (cells + virus) and average RLU between wells containing cells alone, multiplied by 100. The antibody concentration that neutralized 50% of infectivity (IC50) was interpolated from the neutralization curves determined using the log(inhibitor) vs. response—variable slope (four parameters) fit using automatic outlier detection in Graphpad Prism 8.4.

Focus reduction neutralization titer assay

Monoclonal antibodies were serially diluted (three fold) starting at 50ug/mL in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) in duplicate wells and incubated with 100–200 FFU infectious clone derived SARS-CoV-2 virus28 (kindly provided by V. Menachery and P.Y. Shi) at 37 °C for 1 h. The antibody-virus mixture was added to VeroE6 cell (C1008, ATCC, #CRL-1586) monolayers and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Post incubation, the antibody-virus mixture was removed and 100 μL of prewarmed 0.85% methylcellulose (Sigma, #M0512-250) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h, methylcellulose overlay was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following fixation, plates were washed twice with 1x PBS and 100 µl of permeabilization buffer (0.1% BSA-Saponin in PBS) (Sigma Aldrich), was added to the fixated Vero cell monolayer for 20 minutes. Cells were incubated with an anti-SARS-CoV spike protein primary antibody conjugated to biotin (CR3022-biotin) for 1 hour at room temperature, then with avidin-HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Foci were visualized using True Blue HRP substrate and imaged on an ELISPOT reader (CTL). Foci were visualized using an ELISPOT reader (CTL ImmunoSpot S6 Universal Analyzer) and enumerated using Viridot29. The average number of foci in the virus only sample (duplicate) were used to calculate the neutralization curves: 1 − (ratio of mean number of foci in the presence of mAb and virus only control). The antibody concentration that neutralized 50% of infectivity (IC50) was interpolated using a four-parameter nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 8.4.

mAb binding to cell surface expressed SARS-CoV-2 S over time

cDNA for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S isolate USA-WA1/2020 was codon optimized and synthesized by Twist Biosciences and cloned into the pTT3 vector using InFusion cloning (Clontech). pTT3-SARS-CoV-2-S was transfected into HEK-293-6E cells (National Research Council of Canada, under license) using 293 Free transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with shaking. The next day, 200,000 cells in 60 μL of FreeStyle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Pen/Strep were added to a round-bottom 96-well plate. 300 nM mAb in FreeStyle medium and the cells were equilibrated separately for 15 min to 37 °C. At each timepoint (180, 120, 60, 30, 20, 10, 5 min), 30 μL of each mAb were mixed with the cell suspension to a final concentration of 100 nM mAb. After incubation for the allotted time, the samples were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 1 mM EDTA) before staining cells with PE-conjugated AffiniPure Fab fragment goat anti-human IgG (1 : 50 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch, catalog number 109-117-008) for 30 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer and stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (1 : 200 dilution, eBioscience, catalog number 65-0866-14) for 20 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer, fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min on ice in the dark, and resuspended in 200 μL of FACS buffer to be analyzed by flow cytometry using a LSRII (BD). Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each sample was determined at each timepoint and each sample was normalized to the MFI at the 5 min timepoint (MFI/MFI 5 min × 100).

Here, Hurlburt et al. provide the crystal structure of a patient-derived monoclonal antibody neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 via shedding of the S1 subunit and competing f…Recombinant protein expression and purification

The plasmid encoding the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GenBank: MN908947), residues 319–591, were cloned upstream of a C-terminal HRV3C cleavage site, a monomeric Fc-tag, and an 8×His-tag5, and was a gift from Dr. Jason McLellan.

One liter of 293SGlycoDelete cells21 were cultured to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transiently transfected with 500 μg of pαH-RBD-Fc using 2 mg of polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences, catalog number 24765). Cultural supernatant was collected 6 days post transfection by centrifugation and sterile filtered using a 0.22 μm vacuum filter. The RBD was purified using protein A agarose resin (GoldBio, catalog number P-400) and cleaving the Fc domain using HRV3C protease (made in house) on-column. The eluate containing the RBD was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated in 2 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl. Protein was aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C until needed.

Five hundred milliliters of 293-6E cells (National Research Council of Canada (under license)) were cultured to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transiently transfected with 125 μg each of CV30 Heavy and Kappa chains using 1 mg of PEI. Cultural supernatant was collected 6 days post transfection by centrifugation and sterile filtered using a 0.22 μm vacuum filter. IgG was purified using protein A agarose resin and eluted using Pierce IgG Elution Buffer (Thermo Scientific, catalog number 21004). Eluate was pH adjusted to 7.5 using 1 M HEPES pH 7.5. IgG was further purified by SEC using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column. Antigen binding fragment (Fab) was generated by incubating IgG with LysC (New England Biolabs, catalog number P8109S) at a ratio of 1 μg LysC per 10 mg IgG at 37 °C for 18 h. Fab unexpectedly stuck to protein A resin and was eluted as mixture of Fab, undigested IgG, and digested Fc product using the IgG elution buffer. Fab and Fc product was purified by SEC. The CV30 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex was obtained my mixing Fab and Fc product with a twofold molar excess of RBD and incubated for 90 min at room temperature with nutation followed by SEC. The complex was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.

Crystal screening and structure determination

The complex was concentrated to 10 mg/mL for initial crystal screening by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion in the MCSG Crystallization Suite (Anatrace, MCSG-1, MCSG-2, and MCSG-3) using a NT8 drop setter (Formulatrix). Diffracting crystals were obtained in a mother liquor (ML) containing 0.2 M (NH 4 ) Citrate, tribasic pH 7.0 and 12% (w/v) PEG 3350. The crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in ML supplemented with 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source SBC 19-ID at a 12.662 keV. The data set was processed using XDS22 and data reduction was performed using AIMLESS in CCP4 to a resolution of 2.75 Å. The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser23 in Phenix24 with a search model of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDBid: 6LZG)9 and the Fab structure (PDBid: 5I1E)25 divided into Fv and Fc portions. Remaining model building was completed using COOT26 and refinement was performed in Phenix24. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Structural figures were made in PyMol (Schrodinger, LLC).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Immulon 2HB microtiter plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 50 ng/well of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed 4X with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.02% Tween-20 (wash buffer). Plates were blocked with 250 μL of 10% non-fat milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing 4× with wash buffer, purified IgG was added at an initial concentration of 20 μg/mL and diluted in tenfold serial dilutions in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed 4× in wash buffer and the secondary antibody Goat anti-Human Ig-HRP (Southern Biotech, catalog number 2010-05) was added at a 1 : 3000 dilution and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After a final 4× wash, 50 μL of SureBlue Reserve TMB Peroxidase Substrate (SeraCare, catalog number 5120-0081) was added and incubated for 4 min followed by addition of 100 μL of 1 N H 2 SO 4 to stop the reaction. The optical density at 450 nm was measured using a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). All wash steps were performed using a BioTek 405 Select Microplate Washer.

Biolayer interferometry

For kinetic analyses glCV30 was captured on anti-Human IgG Fc capture (AHC) sensors (ForteBio, catalog number 18-5064) at a concentration of 20 μg/mL and loaded for 100 s. After loading, the baseline signal was then recorded for 1 min in KB. The sensors were immersed into wells containing serial dilutions of purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD in KB for 150 s (association phase), followed by immersion in KB for an additional 600 s (dissociation phase). The background signal from each analyte-containing well was measured using VRC01 IgG control reference sensors and subtracted from the signal obtained with each corresponding glCV30 loaded sensor. Kinetic analyses were performed at least twice with an independently prepared analyte dilution series. Curve fitting was performed using a 1 : 1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. Mean k on , k off values were determined by averaging all binding curves that matched the theoretical fit with an R2 value of ≥0.98.

Pseudovirus neutralization assay

HIV-1-derived viral particles were pseudotyped with full-length wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S 27. Briefly, plasmids expressing the HIV-1 Gag and pol (pHDM540 Hgpm2), HIV-1Rev (pRC-CMV-rev1b), HIV-1 Tat (pHDM-tat1b), the SARS-CoV-2 spike (pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike) and a luciferase/GFP reporter (pHAGE-CMV-Luc2-IRES542 ZsGreen-W) were co-transfected into HEK293T (ATCC, catalog number CRL-3216) cells at a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1.6 : 4.6 ratio using 293 Free transfection reagent (EMD Millipore, catalog number 72181) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pseudovirus production was carried out at 32 °C for 72 h after which the culture supernatant was harvested, clarified by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C.

HEK293T cells stably expressing hACE2 (BEI Resources, catalog number NR-5251) were seeded at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well in a 100 µL volume in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. The next day, CV30 and glCV30 were serially diluted (three fold) starting at 50 μg/mL in 30 µL of cDMEM in 96-well round-bottom 27 plates in duplicate or quadruplicate. An equal volume of viral supernatant diluted to result in 2 × 105 luciferase units was added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Meanwhile 50 μL of cDMEM containing 6 µg/mL polybrene was added to each well of 293T-ACE2 cells (2 µg/mL final concentration) and incubated for 30 min. The media was aspirated from 293T-ACE2 cells and 100 µL of the virus-antibody mixture was added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The supernatant was aspirated and replaced with 100 μL of Steadyglo luciferase reagent (Promega). 75 µL was then transferred to an opaque, white bottom plate and read on a Fluorskan Ascent Fluorimeter. Control wells containing virus but no antibody (cells + virus) and no virus or antibody (cells only) were included on each plate.

Percent neutralization for each well was calculated as the relative light units (RLU) of the average of the cells + virus wells, minus test wells (cells + mAb + virus), and dividing this result difference by the average RLU between virus control (cells + virus) and average RLU between wells containing cells alone, multiplied by 100. The antibody concentration that neutralized 50% of infectivity (IC50) was interpolated from the neutralization curves determined using the log(inhibitor) vs. response—variable slope (four parameters) fit using automatic outlier detection in Graphpad Prism 8.4.

Menachery and P.Y. Shi) at 37 °C for 1 h. The antibody-virus mixture was added to VeroE6 cell (C1008, ATCC, #CRL-1586) monolayers and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Post incubation, the antibody-virus mixture was removed and 100 μL of prewarmed 0.85% methylcellulose (Sigma, #M0512-250) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h, methylcellulose overlay was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.

The next day, 200,000 cells in 60 μL of FreeStyle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Pen/Strep were added to a round-bottom 96-well plate. 300 nM mAb in FreeStyle medium and the cells were equilibrated separately for 15 min to 37 °C. At each timepoint (180, 120, 60, 30, 20, 10, 5 min), 30 μL of each mAb were mixed with the cell suspension to a final concentration of 100 nM mAb. After incubation for the allotted time, the samples were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 1 mM EDTA) before staining cells with PE-conjugated AffiniPure Fab fragment goat anti-human IgG (1 : 50 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch, catalog number 109-117-008) for 30 min on ice in the dark.

Today I’m doing the Election 2020 pantry clear-out. Hopefully this is enough to get you started. There’s more, much more… –lambert UPDATE All for now…

Bird Song of the Day

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Case count by United States region:

Slight decrease in slope. Could be noise.

Test positivity by region:

I don’t understand why the sudden dip around a week ago, in every region except the (organge) Northeast (and why does the Northeast keep being the exception?)

Case fatality rate by region:

The Northeast (orange) really stands out. We’ll need to watch this to see if it changes with the increased case count.

Hospitalization by region:

It’s odd that the Northeast hospitalization rate is so low. If the third wave is due to returning students, why is the Northeast seemingly not affected, since it’s such a college-heavy area? Do Northeastern college kids not party? Also, the Northeast (green) stands out for its enormous spikes.

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord

Election Legitimacy

UPDATE MI (1): “Trump Campaign Sues to Stop Michigan From Certifying Election” [Bloomberg]. “President Donald Trump’s campaign has filed another lawsuit in Michigan challenging the election results. The federal lawsuit, which the campaign said it filed late Tuesday, seeks to stop the state from certifying results that show Democrat Joe Biden leading by almost 146,000 votes. The campaign asked a judge to stop Michigan from certifying fraudulent ballots, those received after Election Day, those processed when observers weren’t present, and any counted with defective tabulating machines or software . At least two prior suits contesting the state’s election results have already been rejected by Michigan judges.” • There’s no way to tell if the software is defective or not, even leaving the fact that it’s proprietary. I fear a fabulously destructive decision that legitimizes digital voting, which would be in line with the general Democrat theme that “Elections in our democracy are perfect! Perfect!” MI (2): “Claims that dead people voted went viral. These are the facts” [CNN]. “One of the supposed pieces of evidence was a list that circulated on Twitter Thursday evening allegedly containing names, birth dates, and zip codes for registered voters in Michigan. The origin of the list and the identity of the person who first made it public are not known. CNN examined 50 of the more than 14,000 names on the list by taking the first 25 names on the list and then 25 more picked at random. We ran the names through Michigan’s Voter Information database to see if they requested or returned a ballot. We then checked the names against publicly available records to see if they were indeed dead. Of the 50, 37 were indeed dead and had not voted, according to the voter information database. Five people out of the 50 had voted — and they are all still alive, according to public records accessed by CNN. The remaining eight are also alive but didn’t vote. The sample CNN reviewed is not representative, but the trend was clear — not a single one of the names examined was of a dead person voting.” MI (3): “Republican challenge to Maricopa County election involves fewer than 200 ballots, attorneys say” [AZ Central]. “Republican officials behind a lawsuit alleging poll workers “incorrectly rejected” votes cast in person on Election Day will make their case in front of a Maricopa County Superior Court judge later this week. The defendants — Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors — also will have a chance to produce evidence and make oral arguments, according to Judge Daniel Kiley. But it appears unlikely the case would affect the outcome of the presidential vote. A lawyer for the county said fewer than 200 ballots are at issue.” PA (1): Whoops: cc a lot of people who've been @'ing me recently https://t.co/rocJYkIDxk — Aaron Maté (@aaronjmate) November 10, 2020 PA (2): A thread on the recanting PA postal worker: THREAD: President Donald Trump tonight has retweeted a video of an Erie postal worker who made claims of ballot back-dating by his supervisors. In the video, Richard Hopkins disputes reports that he has recanted his claims. /1 — Matthew Rink (@ETNrink) November 11, 2020 PA (3): “2020 Post-Election War Room” [Democracy Docket]. This morning I complained about the lack of a central place where all the affidavits could be stored. This looks kinda like it. So I go to the active cases in PA to look at this transcript… And it’s only three pages, not the entire transcipt (even though it’s billed as “Read the transcript of the oral argument here”). The site is run, as one might expect I suppose, by Marc Elias of Perkins Coie, of Steele Dossier fame. Elias was the general counsel for the 2016 Clinton campaign. Dudes, come on. Why not the whole transcript? * * * Propaganda works: Yup two thirds of Democrats believe Putin tampered with votes in 2016 to hand Trump the election. https://t.co/T8KSqcwRYr — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) November 10, 2020 Not only did the Democrat base in the PMC achieve class consciousness in 2016-2020, they lost their minds doing it. Kidding! But not entirely…

2020 Democrats in Disarray

AOC was right. Thread: The comments @aoc is making about Democratic ground-game weakness are being dismissed. I have seen, up close, exactly what she is talking about. — Richard Cooke (@rgcooke) November 9, 2020 And: After arriving in Miami, my first task was perfunctory: find out where and when candidates were speaking. For Republicans, this took around 15 minutes. For Democrats, it took five days. — Richard Cooke (@rgcooke) November 9, 2020 The Florida Democrat Party is notoriously useless, and has been for years. Why has this been allowed to continue? UPDATE “Tlaib lashes out at centrist Dems over election debacle: ‘I can’t be silent'” [Politico]. “‘We are not interested in unity that asks people to sacrifice their freedom and their rights any longer,’ said Tlaib, whose Michigan district is among the poorest in the country. ‘And if we truly want to unify our country, we have to really respect every single voice. We say that so willingly when we talk about Trump supporters, but we don’t say that willingly for my Black and brown neighbors and from LGBTQ neighbors or marginalized people.’ Only a few days after the presidential race was called, Tlaib and other progressive leaders are making it clear there will be no honeymoon for Joe Biden. They have their own takeaways from the election: Top progressive groups are circulating a postelection memo that criticizes centrists for playing into Republicans’ ‘divide-and-conquer racism.'” • Yes, I noticed AOC, when taking Democrats to task the other day, did mention racism. But not the working class.

Biden Transition

“Harris’s husband leaving law firm for role in Biden administration” [The Hill]. “‘Mr. Emhoff is working with the Biden-Harris transition team to develop the portfolio he will focus on to support the work of the administration,’ the [Biden campaign] spokesperson said.” • Oh.

2020

UDPATE This entire section now finished. AK: “Alaska Offers Biden the Slimmest of Hopes for a Democratic Senate” [The New Republic]. “But there’s still one more Senate race in the balance, well to the north: Alaska, where election officials will begin counting absentee ballots on Tuesday…. It’s easy enough, after witnessing the dramatic surge in mail-in Joe Biden ballots putting the Democratic president-elect over the top in a fistful of swing states, to imagine that a similar come-from-behind count could catapult Gross (a nominal independent candidate who plans to caucus with the Democrats) into the Senate.” CA (1): “Why California Rejected Racial Preferences, Again” [The Atlantic]. “{ast week, a majority of voters in this Democratic stronghold, where no single ethnic group constitutes a majority, reaffirmed their long-standing preference for neutrality: California voters defeated Proposition 16, an attempt by progressives to remove the provision in the state constitution that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or gender in public employment, education, and contracting. The margin of defeat, 56 to 44 percent, was striking to students of political history, because it suggests that race neutrality is more popular now than when it was initially mandated by a 1996 ballot initiative that passed by a slightly smaller margin. Disappointed progressives fear that Prop 16’s defeat will stymie their efforts to reduce racial inequality. But California voters looking to the future of their wildly diverse state were correct to conclude that permitting its officials to treat racial groups differently would be dangerous.” CA (2): “California’s 40-Year-Old Tax Revolt Survives a Counterattack” [New York Times]. “The new law, Proposition 15, would have removed commercial properties like office buildings and industrial parks from Proposition 13’s limits, and it would have given labor and progressive groups a long-sought victory to increase funding for education and local services. The Associated Press called the result of the Nov. 3 vote on the measure on Tuesday night, when the count was 51.8 percent to 48.2 percent against it.” GA (1): Interesting: THIS JUST IN: The state and local runoffs in Georgia have been moved from December 1 to January 5 to coincide with the crucial senate runoff races Spread the word 🗣 — Georgia Muslim Voter Project (@GAMVP) November 11, 2020 GA (2): Profile in courage: Homie then just support Medicare for all. Don’t do this to yourself and waste everyone’s time phonebanking for you. https://t.co/UkeNyH9Ctq — Ugo Okere 🌹 (@UgoOkere) November 10, 2020 GA (3): “Does Biden Really Want to Win The Senate Runoffs in Georgia?” [Policy Tensor]. “Does Biden really want Democrats to control the Senate? Or is divided government a blessing in disguise from the point of view of the unity of interests? One reason divided government may be a blessing is that it gives the Biden White House considerable leverage against ascendant progressive forces within the party. Bobby Jindal, the Indian-American governor of Louisiana, spelled it on the pages of the Journal yesterday: ‘Strange as it sounds, Mr. Biden needs a Republican Senate majority to serve as a foil. It will give him someone to blame when he proves unable to deliver on left-wing environmental, tax and health-care policies. He can’t say this publicly, but he should be rooting for the Republicans to win the Georgia Senate runoffs.'” • Rather like Cuomo. LA (1): “Louisiana voters reject new tax break in a landslide, after opponents put on full-court press” [The Advocate]. “Louisiana lawmakers earlier this year voted overwhelmingly to ask voters to add a new tax break to the state constitution that would allow manufacturers to negotiate lower tax bills with local governments. On Tuesday, voters rejected the idea in a landslide. All 64 parishes, including GOP and Democratic strongholds, voted against it.” MA (1): Hmm: Massachusetts Senate vacancy Twitter alert: State Rep. Mindy Domb filed a budget amendment that would require the governor to appoint an interim replacement of the same party in the event of a congressional vacancy (h/t @katielannan and @SHNSMurphy https://t.co/Rnjqk7lg3A) pic.twitter.com/hG8HrmpqHZ — Stephanie Murray (@stephanie_murr) November 10, 2020 MA (2): “The Massachusetts Democratic Party’s dirty tricks” [Boston Globe]. “According to the investigation done by Cheryl Jacques, a lawyer and former state lawmaker, Gus Bickford, the state party chairman, encouraged a group of college Democrats to send a letter to Morse raising allegations of sexual misconduct — and to send it just weeks before the Sept. 1 state primary. That letter triggered news stories that essentially dominated the final chapter of the primary contest. The report found that Bickford also encouraged the students to talk to a reporter about the accusations. Those actions violated party rules against interference in a contested primary, the report said. Veronica Martinez, the party’s executive director, also kept ongoing contact with the college students and later told them to delete the text messages and phone records of those communications, according to the Jacques report.” • “Democrats steal primaries….” NY (1): “After Significant Help for State Senate Democrats in 2018, Cuomo Largely Absent from 2020 Races” [Gotham Gazette]. “But as Senate Democrats faced tough races in a number of districts, including some they had won by narrow margins amid a “blue wave” two years ago, New York’s top Democrat seemed to take a relatively hands off approach and did what some believe is the bare minimum to help his party-mates defend or win new seats. Though in 2018, when he was on top of the ticket seeking a third term, Governor Andrew Cuomo was active helping Democrats flip State Senate seats in swing districts from Brooklyn to Long Island to the Hudson Valley, this year he was absent but for a handful of virtual fundraising events and robocalls. Some Democrats believe he mostly prefers the split Legislature he had for his first two terms and very much wanted to avoid the possibility of veto-proof majorities in the two legislative houses.” • Presidential timber! TX (1): “Rio Grande Valley Republicans” [London Review of Books]. “In the end it was the economy that sunk hopes of a Democratic landslide. It was a gigantic mistake to make the election a plebiscite on Trump’s bungling of the pandemic without making an all-out effort to convince voters that a Biden administration would sustain family incomes and small businesses until Covid was defeated. The 2.2 trillion dollar relief bill passed by the House should have been the basis for an aggressive campaign, but the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, allowed the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to take it hostage and Biden, mumbling through the two presidential debates, never really crusaded to free it. Meanwhile, the third-quarter employment figures, however misleading, gave Trump an unexpected boost; they were proof, he claimed, of the shining future ahead. A new national lockdown would send that ‘recovery’ to hell. The Democrats underestimated the resonance this argument had with the shop-owning and entrepreneurial middle classes facing extinction or digestion by Amazon. It wasn’t so hard to convince bar owners, building contractors, franchise managers, small manufacturers and the like that closures were a greater evil than half a million more Covid deaths. (This is, of course, a global phenomenon: just look at the role played by hysterical small business owners in the violent protests against new lockdowns in Western Europe.) As for working people, forced every day to choose between income and health, Biden’s vow to put science in charge of the pandemic was easily spun by Republicans as proof of a economic apocalypse overseen by the dread Dr Fauci. ” • Excellent article worth reading in full. Starts with Democrat organizational blunders in South Texas, but broadens out. TX (2): “Amid record election turnout in Tarrant County, many Latinos stayed home. Here’s why” [Fort Worth Star-Telegram]. “The turnout in precincts where Latinos make up the majority of registered voters was 35% lower than the rest of the county, according to a Star-Telegram analysis of election data…. Experts say Latinos’ concerns vary by gender, geography and national origin, and both parties have largely failed to understand or have ignored the issues that motivate each community to vote. Yolanda Gomez said she did not cast a vote because the lack of outreach by candidates made her feel like her vote doesn’t matter. Gomez, who lives and works at a hair salon in Diamond Hill, voted in 2016 but this time neither candidate connected with her. ‘They only think about the rich people on top,’ she said. ‘They don’t think about us.'” • Needless to say, that’s not what exiled Batista supporters in Miami would say… “How Indigenous voters swung the 2020 election” [HIgh Country News]. “In Arizona and Wisconsin, Native turnout — which often leans liberal — made the difference in Biden’s slim but winning margin.” • Very interesting! “The election-night fiasco in the states that will haunt Democrats for a decade” [Politico]. “One reason it will take a good long time to make sense of the 2020 election is that the results look very different — almost contradictory — when viewed from top-down versus bottom-up. More voters came out than ever in American history to dislodge Trump from the White House. At the same time, his party largely preserved and, in many cases, fortified its advantages deep in the states, where both establishment Republicans and a new breed of Trump loyalists had a very good election. The first question: How bad was the Democratic setback in the states? The answer, the journalists all agreed: Pretty damn bad. It was a comprehensive failure for the Democrats’ hopes of replicating the big GOP victory in 2010, which reached far down into statehouses and allowed Republicans to dominate the redistricting process that gave them a structural advantage for the decade that followed.” • Looks like Obama’s failures continue under Biden, then. * * * “Bernie would have already won” [Carl Beijer]. “The answer to that last one is clear: if you wanted to landslide Trump, you should have nominated Bernie Sanders. There are two basic prongs to this; let’s address them both in turn. (1). Biden’s supposed advantages over Sanders have proven to be grossly overstated. One major argument for Biden, promoted by everyone from his campaign to Lincoln Project / Never-Trump pundits, was that his candidacy would be uniquely appealing to conservatives and Republicans…. Despite highly publicized defections from Trump among elites and a historically unprecedented outreach campaign to Republicans and conservatives, Joe Biden has performed worse among these groups than Hillary Clinton did in 2016…. (2). Biden’s weaknesses were Sanders’s strengths… Biden may have slightly improved on Clinton’s poor showing with poor voters, but he is still significantly underperforming the standard set by Obama in previous years. We have good reason to believe that Sanders — running on a platform of single payer healthcare, generous welfare benefits, and other programs aimed specifically at the poor – would have fared much better…. Note that Sanders also had a higher proportion of voters among the middle income bracket: the group where Biden overperformed, winning a 13 point margin among voters that Democrats have lost since 2008. Meanwhile, the only income group that Biden tended to fare better among — the wealthiest — is the group that he lost to Trump by a decisive 11 points. These numbers correspond directly with standard socialist intuitions about how a Sanders campaign would have played out. He would have run on class war, running up his margins among the poor and middle income brackets (IE, the overwhelming majority of voters) while boxing Trump in among the wealthiest voters. … Sanders also performed strongly among another major voting group that Biden struggled with: Latinos.” • Plausible (even if it is based on exit polling). “The difficult lessons of Democrats’ 2020 victory” [Ryan Cooper, The Week]. “It is increasingly clear that, even with Trump horribly bungling the pandemic response and the ongoing economic crisis, the political background conditions were not as favorable for Biden as they seemed. Polling and reporting confirm that the strong economy of 2018-19 was very popular, as well as the CARES Act checks and boost to unemployment — the most blatant and obvious government support that most Americans have seen in their entire lives. It turns out Trump’s instinct to take credit for all that free money was politically smart!” • No wonder Pelosi wouldn’t take the deal Trump was offering. “Can’t Fight This Feeling Anymore” [Commonweal]. “Now, there are some things Trump had going for him that I will grant immediately. The pre-pandemic economic expansion helped lift many people’s standard of living; it makes sense to me that they would appreciate and remember that, and give the president credit. But he didn’t mention the economic numbers during his rallies these past months as much as he mentioned Fox News scandals and celebrity gossip and the problems with toilets today. He didn’t have a concise or cogent critique of Biden. Was he Sleepy or Crooked? Too mean to cops or too mean to criminals? I’m not on Facebook much, and I don’t watch swing-state TV commercials, so I have no idea if his messaging was more policy-based there. Maybe those were the ads that brought in the new voters. Maybe it was door-to-door canvassing. Maybe it was QAnon. I don’t know. What I do know is that Trump creates a feeling. More than any policy, more than any idea, he makes people feel a way that no one else makes them feel. Powerful. Connected. In on a joke . It’s a celebration and he’s the host. It’s a revival and he’s the preacher.” • I think “in on a joke” is important. I’ve often said that Trump is like a Borscht Belt comedian, and is often very funny (and most of his jokes generate humorless hysteria in liberals, which is probably very satisyfying to those who “get it.” “If you’re listening….”)

Polling

Polling debacle (1): The final WSJ/NBC poll had Biden up by 23 with seniors. Trump ended up winning seniors by 5. At this point, I am essentially done with polling. It is worse than useless, it actively misinforms. What a disaster. https://t.co/ia0k1azhBO — Brian Riedl 🧀 (@Brian_Riedl) November 11, 2020 Polling debacle (2): Massive polling miss in Texas. The RCP average showed Trump +1. Trump will win TX by about +6. pic.twitter.com/kAO5wE9kJM — The Election Wizard🧙‍♂️ (@Wizard_Predicts) November 4, 2020 There are plenty of others, including Collins in Maine. “Not fixable”: The problems outlined here, especially non-random low trust of pollsters, are not fixable by demographic weights. Or any method I can think of—besides already knowing the answer. Not amount of talent or effort can model this. Sometimes one can guess right. Sometimes not. https://t.co/qzCpEGypcq — zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) November 5, 2020 “So what the heck happened with the polls in Pennsylvania? Here are some theories” [The Inquirer]. “For years, pollsters have asked Americans if they have vacations planned, one of many questions intended to take the temperature of the country. But when [Patrick] Murray’s team at the Monmouth University Polling Institute asked in June, the results seemed off: 75% of Democrats said they were planning a summer vacation before the coronavirus struck, compared to just 43% of Republicans. That was an absurd gap for a question that usually elicited little partisan difference. Murray surmised why: Respondents knew the next question would be about if they had to cancel those plans due to the pandemic. And Democrats were eager to blame President Donald Trump for mishandling it, while Republicans didn’t want to make the president look bad.” • “Not fixable….” “What Went Wrong With Polling? Some Early Theories” [Nate Cohn, New York Times]. • I read this twice, and I didn’t see any indication that Cohn considers those polled as active agents when being polled, unlike the two links above. To him, the problems are all technical. * * * This focus group thread is quite illuminating: We're opening with COVID and the economy. Every participant here supports a mask mandate. Half said they were worried about new lockdowns under Biden. "I can't do March and April again," says one mother of three. — Danny Barefoot (@dannybarefoot) November 10, 2020 Worth reading in full.

Our Famously Free Press

“Americans Didn’t Vote Against Trump, They Voted Against More Media Psychological Abuse” [Caitlin Johnstone (JZ)]. “Instead, they were psychologically terrorized. Made frightened, sick and traumatized by mass media pundits who only care about ratings and clicks, as was made clear when CBS chief Les Moonves famously said that Trump is bad for America but great for CBS. Dragged through years of Russia hysteria and Trump hysteria with any excuse to spin Trump’s presidency as a remarkable departure from norms, when in reality it was anything but. It was a fairly conventional Republican presidency…. In reality, though most of them probably did not realize it, this is what Americans were actually voting against when they turned out in record numbers to cast their votes. Not against Trump, but against this continued psychological abuse they’ve been suffering both directly and indirectly from the mass media. Against being bashed in the face by shrieking, hysterical bullshit that hurts their bodies and makes them feel crazy, and against the unpleasantness of having to interact with stressed-out compatriots who haven’t been putting up well with the abuse. It wasn’t a ‘Get him out’ vote, it was a ‘Make it stop’ vote.” • Intriguing, but I haven’t heard any anecdotes that support this….

One FANG Rout Doesn’t Make a Market Revolution Bloomberg

Mr. Market: “One FANG Rout Doesn’t Make a Market Revolution” [John Authers, Bloomberg]. “Kriti is unquestionably right that we don’t yet know if Monday’s extraordinary market convulsion is the beginning of a wider rotation. She’s also right that we can only know for sure with hindsight. But it would still help to know if we are at the beginning of that process. So let’s examine the issue.”

Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 65 Greed (previous close: 58 Greed) [CNN]. One week ago: 34 (Fear). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 11 at 12:19pm. Tooling along nicely now.

Health Care

“Pfizer CEO unloads $5.6M of stock as coronavirus vaccine hopes send shares soaring” [FOX]. “Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sold $5.6 million of company stock Monday as shares soared 15% on the news that a late-stage trial found the company’s COVID-19 vaccine to be 90% effective… ‘The sale of these shares is part of Dr. Bourla’s personal financial planning and a pre-established (10b5-1) plan, which allows, under SEC rules, major shareholders and insiders of exchange-listed corporations to trade a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time,’ a Pfizer spokesperson said in a statement.” • Doesn’t Bourla expect his stock to appreciate? I’m still queasy.

“Biden’s pandemic plan: Restore Obamacare, mandatory masks, paid sick leave and free COVID-19 tests” [MarketWatch]. • But not free treatment. Seems a little minimalist. And the article doesn’t even mention contact tracing, whether forward or backward.

“Nursing Home Quality, Covid-19 Deaths, and Excess Mortality” (PDF) [Christopher J. Cronin, William N. Evans NBER]. “Quickly after the pandemic hit the US, most nursing homes banned all visitors, disrupting the daily routines of many residents. An abundance of qualitative evidence from nursing home staff, administrators, and resident family members suggests that the lack of in-person contact with loved ones and other residents is not only generating feelings of loneliness, isolation, and despair, but may also expedite death (Aronson, 2020; Paulin, 2020; Graham, 2020). Population-wide trends in mortality support this claim. ”

“Government gears for unprecedented challenge of Eli Lilly antibody rollout as efficacy questions linger” [EndPoints]. “On Tuesday, CDER chief Janet Woodcock, who stepped away from the FDA to run the treatment arm of Operation Warp Speed, outlined the government’s plan to distribute the 300,000 doses they’ve agreed to purchase from Eli Lilly. They will rely largely on a system that officials eventually developed for distributing remdesivir: Rather than give the drug directly to medical centers, they will allocate it to states and territories according to how many Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations they have. Local governments would then allocate it within their jurisdictions.”

“Speed, Evidence, and Safety Characteristics of Vaccine Approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration” [JAMA]. “Since 2010, most novel vaccines approved by the FDA required about 8 years of clinical development and were based on evidence from a median of 7 clinical trials, including at least 2 pivotal efficacy trials that were randomized, masked, and used a comparator group. These pivotal efficacy trials enrolled a median of 5000 patients, who were followed up for serious adverse events for at least 6 months. Given the urgency of developing a COVID-19 vaccine, trials will need to be larger than those supporting prior vaccine approvals and include sufficient follow-up time for emergence of adverse effects.”

“Biden Wants To Lower Medicare Eligibility Age To 60, But Hospitals Push Back” [NPR]. “Of his many plans to expand insurance coverage, President-elect Joe Biden’s simplest strategy is lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60. But the plan is sure to face long odds, even if the Democrats can snag control of the Senate in January by winning two runoff elections in Georgia. Republicans, who fought the creation of Medicare in the 1960s and typically oppose expanding government entitlement programs, are not the biggest obstacle. Instead, the nation’s hospitals — a powerful political force — are poised to derail any effort. Hospitals fear adding millions of people to Medicare will cost them billions of dollars in revenue.”

“Opinion: Picking the wrong health insurance is a $2,000 mistake” [MarketWatch]. “Almost a quarter of employees faced with the choice of two employer-sponsored health-care plans picked the one that left them worse off financially, even though they offered the same non-cost benefits, according to new unpublished research we conducted. Using data from a large university in the Midwest that offered to subsidize one of two health-care plans, we wanted to see how hard it is for people to make the better choice when given only two options. The plans were identical in every respect other than their costs. One plan had much higher premiums but lower out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-payments for the employee. Our analysis found that 97% of the 2,300 employees would have been better off with the other plan, which had lower premiums but higher cost-sharing. Yet 23% chose the higher-premium plan anyway. The average cost per year of choosing the wrong plan was over $2,000, according to our paper, which we plan to submit for publication soon.” • First, why are people even forced into this insane choice? What is the point? Second, perhaps the “high premium”/”low deductibles” plan let those who chose it sleep better at night. Who wants to stump $10,000 as soon as they need care?

Games

“On Animal Crossing and the Ghosts of Empire” [Amy Stanley] “This brings us to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It goes like this: Your avatar is sent to a deserted island with a unique layout and a certain kind of indigenous fruit tree (mine is an orange) and a certain kind of indigenous flower (mine is a lily). An enthusiastic but dimwitted capitalist named Nook has sponsored the journey, and he expects to be paid back, but – as will be the case throughout the game – he charges no interest. You arrive along with other newcomers, your “villagers,” and your task is to develop the island by creating habitations and infrastructure. The best way to earn money is to harvest the natural resources of the island and sell them to a petty shopkeeper; you can also use these resources to construct tools that will aid you in development. Eventually, you meet a naturalist who wants to build a museum on your island, so you donate materials for his collections. You can do all this while dressed in an increasingly varied and ridiculous series of outfits. That, more or less, is the game. All of this – including the construction of new infrastructure, the intense interest in natural phenomena, and the ridiculous outfits – sounds a lot like an early twentieth-century colonial enterprise. In fact, it is distressingly reminiscent of the Japanese empire itself.”

Black Injustice Tipping Point

“The Only Successful Coup in the US Began as a Campaign to Curb Black Voting Rights” [Literary Hub]. “One of the main Democratic campaign themes was that if their party were not returned to power, there would be an epidemic of attacks by black men on white women. To stoke those fires, a statewide Democratic newspaper, The News and Observer, reprinted an August 1897 speech by Rebecca Latimer Felton, a Georgia suffragette, who would later become the first woman to serve in the United States Senate. ‘If it requires lynching to protect woman’s dearest possession from ravening, drunken human beasts.'” • Yikes! Worth reading in full.

News of the Wired

“Are Straight People OK? How We Can Improve Heterosexuality” [Teen Vogue]. “Even though straight culture is understood as flawed, it’s still our society’s default, reinforced by everything from the wedding industrial complex to romantic comedies to Beyonce songs. We’re told by pop culture and capitalism alike that it is easier and safer to participate in straight culture than it is to be queer. Jane Ward, a professor of gender and sexuality at UC-Riverside and a lesbian who identifies as an ally to the straights, wants to change that presumption—but also our cynicism about the possibility of straight sex and love.” • “Identifies as an ally.” Is that the same as actually being an ally?

“One hundred years of ‘We'” [The New Criterion]. “Yevgeny Zamyatin wrote We in 1920, during the Russian Civil War. Composed at the dawn of the Soviet era—a not-so-distant mirror of our own troubled and dangerous times—We was first published in the USSR in 1988, at its dusk. The manuscript, a stunning prophecy of totalitarianism and a classic of dystopian literature, was one of several works that prompted a newspaper and magazine campaign against the author…. Zamyatin is among the few gifted twentieth-century writers who responded to ideological tyranny by poetically integrating mathematical science into a philosophical anthropology…. A trained scientist, Zamyatin designed and supervised the construction of icebreakers in England during the Great War. In We, mathematics (the language of the totalitarian OneState) and poetry (the language of its revolutionary opponents) are the antipodes around which humanly fundamental oppositions coalesce: necessity and freedom; order and chaos; entropy and energy; rationality and irrationality; utility and beauty; force and love; tameness and wildness; social totality and individual infinity. The drama of We plays out in the charged space between these poles: a field of electrical attraction and repulsion where opposites merge, unities split apart, and nothing stands still for long.”

Bird Song of the Day

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Case count by United States region:

Slight decrease in slope. Could be noise.

Test positivity by region:

I don’t understand why the sudden dip around a week ago, in every region except the (organge) Northeast (and why does the Northeast keep being the exception?)

Case fatality rate by region:

The Northeast (orange) really stands out. We’ll need to watch this to see if it changes with the increased case count.

Hospitalization by region:

It’s odd that the Northeast hospitalization rate is so low. If the third wave is due to returning students, why is the Northeast seemingly not affected, since it’s such a college-heavy area? Do Northeastern college kids not party? Also, the Northeast (green) stands out for its enormous spikes.

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord

Election Legitimacy

UPDATE MI (1): “Trump Campaign Sues to Stop Michigan From Certifying Election” [Bloomberg]. “President Donald Trump’s campaign has filed another lawsuit in Michigan challenging the election results. The federal lawsuit, which the campaign said it filed late Tuesday, seeks to stop the state from certifying results that show Democrat Joe Biden leading by almost 146,000 votes. The campaign asked a judge to stop Michigan from certifying fraudulent ballots, those received after Election Day, those processed when observers weren’t present, and any counted with defective tabulating machines or software . At least two prior suits contesting the state’s election results have already been rejected by Michigan judges.” • There’s no way to tell if the software is defective or not, even leaving the fact that it’s proprietary. I fear a fabulously destructive decision that legitimizes digital voting, which would be in line with the general Democrat theme that “Elections in our democracy are perfect! Perfect!” MI (2): “Claims that dead people voted went viral. These are the facts” [CNN]. “One of the supposed pieces of evidence was a list that circulated on Twitter Thursday evening allegedly containing names, birth dates, and zip codes for registered voters in Michigan. The origin of the list and the identity of the person who first made it public are not known. CNN examined 50 of the more than 14,000 names on the list by taking the first 25 names on the list and then 25 more picked at random. We ran the names through Michigan’s Voter Information database to see if they requested or returned a ballot. We then checked the names against publicly available records to see if they were indeed dead. Of the 50, 37 were indeed dead and had not voted, according to the voter information database. Five people out of the 50 had voted — and they are all still alive, according to public records accessed by CNN. The remaining eight are also alive but didn’t vote. The sample CNN reviewed is not representative, but the trend was clear — not a single one of the names examined was of a dead person voting.” MI (3): “Republican challenge to Maricopa County election involves fewer than 200 ballots, attorneys say” [AZ Central]. “Republican officials behind a lawsuit alleging poll workers “incorrectly rejected” votes cast in person on Election Day will make their case in front of a Maricopa County Superior Court judge later this week. The defendants — Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors — also will have a chance to produce evidence and make oral arguments, according to Judge Daniel Kiley. But it appears unlikely the case would affect the outcome of the presidential vote. A lawyer for the county said fewer than 200 ballots are at issue.” PA (1): Whoops: cc a lot of people who've been @'ing me recently https://t.co/rocJYkIDxk — Aaron Maté (@aaronjmate) November 10, 2020 PA (2): A thread on the recanting PA postal worker: THREAD: President Donald Trump tonight has retweeted a video of an Erie postal worker who made claims of ballot back-dating by his supervisors.

2020 Democrats in Disarray

AOC was right. Thread: The comments @aoc is making about Democratic ground-game weakness are being dismissed. I have seen, up close, exactly what she is talking about. — Richard Cooke (@rgcooke) November 9, 2020 And: After arriving in Miami, my first task was perfunctory: find out where and when candidates were speaking. For Republicans, this took around 15 minutes. For Democrats, it took five days. — Richard Cooke (@rgcooke) November 9, 2020 The Florida Democrat Party is notoriously useless, and has been for years. Why has this been allowed to continue? UPDATE “Tlaib lashes out at centrist Dems over election debacle: ‘I can’t be silent'” [Politico]. “‘We are not interested in unity that asks people to sacrifice their freedom and their rights any longer,’ said Tlaib, whose Michigan district is among the poorest in the country. ‘And if we truly want to unify our country, we have to really respect every single voice. We say that so willingly when we talk about Trump supporters, but we don’t say that willingly for my Black and brown neighbors and from LGBTQ neighbors or marginalized people.’ Only a few days after the presidential race was called, Tlaib and other progressive leaders are making it clear there will be no honeymoon for Joe Biden. They have their own takeaways from the election: Top progressive groups are circulating a postelection memo that criticizes centrists for playing into Republicans’ ‘divide-and-conquer racism.'” • Yes, I noticed AOC, when taking Democrats to task the other day, did mention racism. But not the working class.

Biden Transition

“Harris’s husband leaving law firm for role in Biden administration” [The Hill]. “‘Mr. Emhoff is working with the Biden-Harris transition team to develop the portfolio he will focus on to support the work of the administration,’ the [Biden campaign] spokesperson said.” • Oh.

2020

UDPATE This entire section now finished. AK: “Alaska Offers Biden the Slimmest of Hopes for a Democratic Senate” [The New Republic]. “But there’s still one more Senate race in the balance, well to the north: Alaska, where election officials will begin counting absentee ballots on Tuesday…. It’s easy enough, after witnessing the dramatic surge in mail-in Joe Biden ballots putting the Democratic president-elect over the top in a fistful of swing states, to imagine that a similar come-from-behind count could catapult Gross (a nominal independent candidate who plans to caucus with the Democrats) into the Senate.” CA (1): “Why California Rejected Racial Preferences, Again” [The Atlantic]. “{ast week, a majority of voters in this Democratic stronghold, where no single ethnic group constitutes a majority, reaffirmed their long-standing preference for neutrality: California voters defeated Proposition 16, an attempt by progressives to remove the provision in the state constitution that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or gender in public employment, education, and contracting. The margin of defeat, 56 to 44 percent, was striking to students of political history, because it suggests that race neutrality is more popular now than when it was initially mandated by a 1996 ballot initiative that passed by a slightly smaller margin. Disappointed progressives fear that Prop 16’s defeat will stymie their efforts to reduce racial inequality. But California voters looking to the future of their wildly diverse state were correct to conclude that permitting its officials to treat racial groups differently would be dangerous.” CA (2): “California’s 40-Year-Old Tax Revolt Survives a Counterattack” [New York Times]. “The new law, Proposition 15, would have removed commercial properties like office buildings and industrial parks from Proposition 13’s limits, and it would have given labor and progressive groups a long-sought victory to increase funding for education and local services. The Associated Press called the result of the Nov. 3 vote on the measure on Tuesday night, when the count was 51.8 percent to 48.2 percent against it.” GA (1): Interesting: THIS JUST IN: The state and local runoffs in Georgia have been moved from December 1 to January 5 to coincide with the crucial senate runoff races Spread the word 🗣 — Georgia Muslim Voter Project (@GAMVP) November 11, 2020 GA (2): Profile in courage: Homie then just support Medicare for all. Don’t do this to yourself and waste everyone’s time phonebanking for you. https://t.co/UkeNyH9Ctq — Ugo Okere 🌹 (@UgoOkere) November 10, 2020 GA (3): “Does Biden Really Want to Win The Senate Runoffs in Georgia?” [Policy Tensor]. “Does Biden really want Democrats to control the Senate? Or is divided government a blessing in disguise from the point of view of the unity of interests? One reason divided government may be a blessing is that it gives the Biden White House considerable leverage against ascendant progressive forces within the party. Bobby Jindal, the Indian-American governor of Louisiana, spelled it on the pages of the Journal yesterday: ‘Strange as it sounds, Mr. Biden needs a Republican Senate majority to serve as a foil. It will give him someone to blame when he proves unable to deliver on left-wing environmental, tax and health-care policies. He can’t say this publicly, but he should be rooting for the Republicans to win the Georgia Senate runoffs.'” • Rather like Cuomo. LA (1): “Louisiana voters reject new tax break in a landslide, after opponents put on full-court press” [The Advocate]. “Louisiana lawmakers earlier this year voted overwhelmingly to ask voters to add a new tax break to the state constitution that would allow manufacturers to negotiate lower tax bills with local governments. On Tuesday, voters rejected the idea in a landslide. All 64 parishes, including GOP and Democratic strongholds, voted against it.” MA (1): Hmm: Massachusetts Senate vacancy Twitter alert: State Rep. Mindy Domb filed a budget amendment that would require the governor to appoint an interim replacement of the same party in the event of a congressional vacancy (h/t @katielannan and @SHNSMurphy https://t.co/Rnjqk7lg3A) pic.twitter.com/hG8HrmpqHZ — Stephanie Murray (@stephanie_murr) November 10, 2020 MA (2): “The Massachusetts Democratic Party’s dirty tricks” [Boston Globe]. “According to the investigation done by Cheryl Jacques, a lawyer and former state lawmaker, Gus Bickford, the state party chairman, encouraged a group of college Democrats to send a letter to Morse raising allegations of sexual misconduct — and to send it just weeks before the Sept. 1 state primary. That letter triggered news stories that essentially dominated the final chapter of the primary contest. The report found that Bickford also encouraged the students to talk to a reporter about the accusations. Those actions violated party rules against interference in a contested primary, the report said. Veronica Martinez, the party’s executive director, also kept ongoing contact with the college students and later told them to delete the text messages and phone records of those communications, according to the Jacques report.” • “Democrats steal primaries….” NY (1): “After Significant Help for State Senate Democrats in 2018, Cuomo Largely Absent from 2020 Races” [Gotham Gazette]. “But as Senate Democrats faced tough races in a number of districts, including some they had won by narrow margins amid a “blue wave” two years ago, New York’s top Democrat seemed to take a relatively hands off approach and did what some believe is the bare minimum to help his party-mates defend or win new seats. Though in 2018, when he was on top of the ticket seeking a third term, Governor Andrew Cuomo was active helping Democrats flip State Senate seats in swing districts from Brooklyn to Long Island to the Hudson Valley, this year he was absent but for a handful of virtual fundraising events and robocalls. Some Democrats believe he mostly prefers the split Legislature he had for his first two terms and very much wanted to avoid the possibility of veto-proof majorities in the two legislative houses.” • Presidential timber! TX (1): “Rio Grande Valley Republicans” [London Review of Books]. “In the end it was the economy that sunk hopes of a Democratic landslide. It was a gigantic mistake to make the election a plebiscite on Trump’s bungling of the pandemic without making an all-out effort to convince voters that a Biden administration would sustain family incomes and small businesses until Covid was defeated. The 2.2 trillion dollar relief bill passed by the House should have been the basis for an aggressive campaign, but the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, allowed the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to take it hostage and Biden, mumbling through the two presidential debates, never really crusaded to free it. Meanwhile, the third-quarter employment figures, however misleading, gave Trump an unexpected boost; they were proof, he claimed, of the shining future ahead. A new national lockdown would send that ‘recovery’ to hell. The Democrats underestimated the resonance this argument had with the shop-owning and entrepreneurial middle classes facing extinction or digestion by Amazon. It wasn’t so hard to convince bar owners, building contractors, franchise managers, small manufacturers and the like that closures were a greater evil than half a million more Covid deaths. (This is, of course, a global phenomenon: just look at the role played by hysterical small business owners in the violent protests against new lockdowns in Western Europe.) As for working people, forced every day to choose between income and health, Biden’s vow to put science in charge of the pandemic was easily spun by Republicans as proof of a economic apocalypse overseen by the dread Dr Fauci. ” • Excellent article worth reading in full. Starts with Democrat organizational blunders in South Texas, but broadens out. TX (2): “Amid record election turnout in Tarrant County, many Latinos stayed home. Here’s why” [Fort Worth Star-Telegram]. “The turnout in precincts where Latinos make up the majority of registered voters was 35% lower than the rest of the county, according to a Star-Telegram analysis of election data…. Experts say Latinos’ concerns vary by gender, geography and national origin, and both parties have largely failed to understand or have ignored the issues that motivate each community to vote. Yolanda Gomez said she did not cast a vote because the lack of outreach by candidates made her feel like her vote doesn’t matter. Gomez, who lives and works at a hair salon in Diamond Hill, voted in 2016 but this time neither candidate connected with her. ‘They only think about the rich people on top,’ she said. ‘They don’t think about us.'” • Needless to say, that’s not what exiled Batista supporters in Miami would say… “How Indigenous voters swung the 2020 election” [HIgh Country News]. “In Arizona and Wisconsin, Native turnout — which often leans liberal — made the difference in Biden’s slim but winning margin.” • Very interesting! “The election-night fiasco in the states that will haunt Democrats for a decade” [Politico]. “One reason it will take a good long time to make sense of the 2020 election is that the results look very different — almost contradictory — when viewed from top-down versus bottom-up. More voters came out than ever in American history to dislodge Trump from the White House. At the same time, his party largely preserved and, in many cases, fortified its advantages deep in the states, where both establishment Republicans and a new breed of Trump loyalists had a very good election. The first question: How bad was the Democratic setback in the states? The answer, the journalists all agreed: Pretty damn bad. It was a comprehensive failure for the Democrats’ hopes of replicating the big GOP victory in 2010, which reached far down into statehouses and allowed Republicans to dominate the redistricting process that gave them a structural advantage for the decade that followed.” • Looks like Obama’s failures continue under Biden, then. * * * “Bernie would have already won” [Carl Beijer]. “The answer to that last one is clear: if you wanted to landslide Trump, you should have nominated Bernie Sanders. There are two basic prongs to this; let’s address them both in turn. (1). Biden’s supposed advantages over Sanders have proven to be grossly overstated. One major argument for Biden, promoted by everyone from his campaign to Lincoln Project / Never-Trump pundits, was that his candidacy would be uniquely appealing to conservatives and Republicans…. Despite highly publicized defections from Trump among elites and a historically unprecedented outreach campaign to Republicans and conservatives, Joe Biden has performed worse among these groups than Hillary Clinton did in 2016…. (2). Biden’s weaknesses were Sanders’s strengths… Biden may have slightly improved on Clinton’s poor showing with poor voters, but he is still significantly underperforming the standard set by Obama in previous years. We have good reason to believe that Sanders — running on a platform of single payer healthcare, generous welfare benefits, and other programs aimed specifically at the poor – would have fared much better…. Note that Sanders also had a higher proportion of voters among the middle income bracket: the group where Biden overperformed, winning a 13 point margin among voters that Democrats have lost since 2008. Meanwhile, the only income group that Biden tended to fare better among — the wealthiest — is the group that he lost to Trump by a decisive 11 points. These numbers correspond directly with standard socialist intuitions about how a Sanders campaign would have played out. He would have run on class war, running up his margins among the poor and middle income brackets (IE, the overwhelming majority of voters) while boxing Trump in among the wealthiest voters. … Sanders also performed strongly among another major voting group that Biden struggled with: Latinos.” • Plausible (even if it is based on exit polling). “The difficult lessons of Democrats’ 2020 victory” [Ryan Cooper, The Week]. “It is increasingly clear that, even with Trump horribly bungling the pandemic response and the ongoing economic crisis, the political background conditions were not as favorable for Biden as they seemed. Polling and reporting confirm that the strong economy of 2018-19 was very popular, as well as the CARES Act checks and boost to unemployment — the most blatant and obvious government support that most Americans have seen in their entire lives. It turns out Trump’s instinct to take credit for all that free money was politically smart!” • No wonder Pelosi wouldn’t take the deal Trump was offering. “Can’t Fight This Feeling Anymore” [Commonweal]. “Now, there are some things Trump had going for him that I will grant immediately. The pre-pandemic economic expansion helped lift many people’s standard of living; it makes sense to me that they would appreciate and remember that, and give the president credit. But he didn’t mention the economic numbers during his rallies these past months as much as he mentioned Fox News scandals and celebrity gossip and the problems with toilets today. He didn’t have a concise or cogent critique of Biden. Was he Sleepy or Crooked? Too mean to cops or too mean to criminals? I’m not on Facebook much, and I don’t watch swing-state TV commercials, so I have no idea if his messaging was more policy-based there. Maybe those were the ads that brought in the new voters. Maybe it was door-to-door canvassing. Maybe it was QAnon. I don’t know. What I do know is that Trump creates a feeling. More than any policy, more than any idea, he makes people feel a way that no one else makes them feel. Powerful. Connected. In on a joke . It’s a celebration and he’s the host. It’s a revival and he’s the preacher.” • I think “in on a joke” is important. I’ve often said that Trump is like a Borscht Belt comedian, and is often very funny (and most of his jokes generate humorless hysteria in liberals, which is probably very satisyfying to those who “get it.” “If you’re listening….”)

Polling

Polling debacle (1): The final WSJ/NBC poll had Biden up by 23 with seniors. Trump ended up winning seniors by 5. At this point, I am essentially done with polling. It is worse than useless, it actively misinforms. What a disaster. https://t.co/ia0k1azhBO — Brian Riedl 🧀 (@Brian_Riedl) November 11, 2020 Polling debacle (2): Massive polling miss in Texas. The RCP average showed Trump +1. Trump will win TX by about +6. pic.twitter.com/kAO5wE9kJM — The Election Wizard🧙‍♂️ (@Wizard_Predicts) November 4, 2020 There are plenty of others, including Collins in Maine. “Not fixable”: The problems outlined here, especially non-random low trust of pollsters, are not fixable by demographic weights. Or any method I can think of—besides already knowing the answer. Not amount of talent or effort can model this. Sometimes one can guess right. Sometimes not. https://t.co/qzCpEGypcq — zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) November 5, 2020 “So what the heck happened with the polls in Pennsylvania? Here are some theories” [The Inquirer]. “For years, pollsters have asked Americans if they have vacations planned, one of many questions intended to take the temperature of the country. But when [Patrick] Murray’s team at the Monmouth University Polling Institute asked in June, the results seemed off: 75% of Democrats said they were planning a summer vacation before the coronavirus struck, compared to just 43% of Republicans. That was an absurd gap for a question that usually elicited little partisan difference. Murray surmised why: Respondents knew the next question would be about if they had to cancel those plans due to the pandemic. And Democrats were eager to blame President Donald Trump for mishandling it, while Republicans didn’t want to make the president look bad.” • “Not fixable….” “What Went Wrong With Polling? Some Early Theories” [Nate Cohn, New York Times]. • I read this twice, and I didn’t see any indication that Cohn considers those polled as active agents when being polled, unlike the two links above. To him, the problems are all technical. * * * This focus group thread is quite illuminating: We're opening with COVID and the economy. Every participant here supports a mask mandate. Half said they were worried about new lockdowns under Biden. "I can't do March and April again," says one mother of three. — Danny Barefoot (@dannybarefoot) November 10, 2020 Worth reading in full.

Our Famously Free Press

“Americans Didn’t Vote Against Trump, They Voted Against More Media Psychological Abuse” [Caitlin Johnstone (JZ)]. “Instead, they were psychologically terrorized. Made frightened, sick and traumatized by mass media pundits who only care about ratings and clicks, as was made clear when CBS chief Les Moonves famously said that Trump is bad for America but great for CBS. Dragged through years of Russia hysteria and Trump hysteria with any excuse to spin Trump’s presidency as a remarkable departure from norms, when in reality it was anything but. It was a fairly conventional Republican presidency…. In reality, though most of them probably did not realize it, this is what Americans were actually voting against when they turned out in record numbers to cast their votes. Not against Trump, but against this continued psychological abuse they’ve been suffering both directly and indirectly from the mass media. Against being bashed in the face by shrieking, hysterical bullshit that hurts their bodies and makes them feel crazy, and against the unpleasantness of having to interact with stressed-out compatriots who haven’t been putting up well with the abuse. It wasn’t a ‘Get him out’ vote, it was a ‘Make it stop’ vote.” • Intriguing, but I haven’t heard any anecdotes that support this….

One FANG Rout Doesn’t Make a Market Revolution Bloomberg

Mr. Market: “One FANG Rout Doesn’t Make a Market Revolution” [John Authers, Bloomberg]. “Kriti is unquestionably right that we don’t yet know if Monday’s extraordinary market convulsion is the beginning of a wider rotation. She’s also right that we can only know for sure with hindsight. But it would still help to know if we are at the beginning of that process. So let’s examine the issue.”

Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 65 Greed (previous close: 58 Greed) [CNN]. One week ago: 34 (Fear). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 11 at 12:19pm. Tooling along nicely now.

Health Care

“Pfizer CEO unloads $5.6M of stock as coronavirus vaccine hopes send shares soaring” [FOX]. “Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sold $5.6 million of company stock Monday as shares soared 15% on the news that a late-stage trial found the company’s COVID-19 vaccine to be 90% effective… ‘The sale of these shares is part of Dr. Bourla’s personal financial planning and a pre-established (10b5-1) plan, which allows, under SEC rules, major shareholders and insiders of exchange-listed corporations to trade a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time,’ a Pfizer spokesperson said in a statement.” • Doesn’t Bourla expect his stock to appreciate? I’m still queasy.

“Biden’s pandemic plan: Restore Obamacare, mandatory masks, paid sick leave and free COVID-19 tests” [MarketWatch]. • But not free treatment. Seems a little minimalist. And the article doesn’t even mention contact tracing, whether forward or backward.

“Nursing Home Quality, Covid-19 Deaths, and Excess Mortality” (PDF) [Christopher J. Cronin, William N. Evans NBER]. “Quickly after the pandemic hit the US, most nursing homes banned all visitors, disrupting the daily routines of many residents. An abundance of qualitative evidence from nursing home staff, administrators, and resident family members suggests that the lack of in-person contact with loved ones and other residents is not only generating feelings of loneliness, isolation, and despair, but may also expedite death (Aronson, 2020; Paulin, 2020; Graham, 2020). Population-wide trends in mortality support this claim. ”

“Government gears for unprecedented challenge of Eli Lilly antibody rollout as efficacy questions linger” [EndPoints]. “On Tuesday, CDER chief Janet Woodcock, who stepped away from the FDA to run the treatment arm of Operation Warp Speed, outlined the government’s plan to distribute the 300,000 doses they’ve agreed to purchase from Eli Lilly. They will rely largely on a system that officials eventually developed for distributing remdesivir: Rather than give the drug directly to medical centers, they will allocate it to states and territories according to how many Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations they have. Local governments would then allocate it within their jurisdictions.”

“Speed, Evidence, and Safety Characteristics of Vaccine Approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration” [JAMA]. “Since 2010, most novel vaccines approved by the FDA required about 8 years of clinical development and were based on evidence from a median of 7 clinical trials, including at least 2 pivotal efficacy trials that were randomized, masked, and used a comparator group. These pivotal efficacy trials enrolled a median of 5000 patients, who were followed up for serious adverse events for at least 6 months. Given the urgency of developing a COVID-19 vaccine, trials will need to be larger than those supporting prior vaccine approvals and include sufficient follow-up time for emergence of adverse effects.”

“Biden Wants To Lower Medicare Eligibility Age To 60, But Hospitals Push Back” [NPR]. “Of his many plans to expand insurance coverage, President-elect Joe Biden’s simplest strategy is lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60. But the plan is sure to face long odds, even if the Democrats can snag control of the Senate in January by winning two runoff elections in Georgia. Republicans, who fought the creation of Medicare in the 1960s and typically oppose expanding government entitlement programs, are not the biggest obstacle. Instead, the nation’s hospitals — a powerful political force — are poised to derail any effort. Hospitals fear adding millions of people to Medicare will cost them billions of dollars in revenue.”

“Opinion: Picking the wrong health insurance is a $2,000 mistake” [MarketWatch]. “Almost a quarter of employees faced with the choice of two employer-sponsored health-care plans picked the one that left them worse off financially, even though they offered the same non-cost benefits, according to new unpublished research we conducted. Using data from a large university in the Midwest that offered to subsidize one of two health-care plans, we wanted to see how hard it is for people to make the better choice when given only two options. The plans were identical in every respect other than their costs. One plan had much higher premiums but lower out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-payments for the employee. Our analysis found that 97% of the 2,300 employees would have been better off with the other plan, which had lower premiums but higher cost-sharing. Yet 23% chose the higher-premium plan anyway. The average cost per year of choosing the wrong plan was over $2,000, according to our paper, which we plan to submit for publication soon.” • First, why are people even forced into this insane choice? What is the point? Second, perhaps the “high premium”/”low deductibles” plan let those who chose it sleep better at night. Who wants to stump $10,000 as soon as they need care?

Games

“On Animal Crossing and the Ghosts of Empire” [Amy Stanley] “This brings us to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It goes like this: Your avatar is sent to a deserted island with a unique layout and a certain kind of indigenous fruit tree (mine is an orange) and a certain kind of indigenous flower (mine is a lily). An enthusiastic but dimwitted capitalist named Nook has sponsored the journey, and he expects to be paid back, but – as will be the case throughout the game – he charges no interest. You arrive along with other newcomers, your “villagers,” and your task is to develop the island by creating habitations and infrastructure. The best way to earn money is to harvest the natural resources of the island and sell them to a petty shopkeeper; you can also use these resources to construct tools that will aid you in development. Eventually, you meet a naturalist who wants to build a museum on your island, so you donate materials for his collections. You can do all this while dressed in an increasingly varied and ridiculous series of outfits. That, more or less, is the game. All of this – including the construction of new infrastructure, the intense interest in natural phenomena, and the ridiculous outfits – sounds a lot like an early twentieth-century colonial enterprise. In fact, it is distressingly reminiscent of the Japanese empire itself.”

Black Injustice Tipping Point

“The Only Successful Coup in the US Began as a Campaign to Curb Black Voting Rights” [Literary Hub]. “One of the main Democratic campaign themes was that if their party were not returned to power, there would be an epidemic of attacks by black men on white women. To stoke those fires, a statewide Democratic newspaper, The News and Observer, reprinted an August 1897 speech by Rebecca Latimer Felton, a Georgia suffragette, who would later become the first woman to serve in the United States Senate. ‘If it requires lynching to protect woman’s dearest possession from ravening, drunken human beasts.'” • Yikes! Worth reading in full.

News of the Wired

“Are Straight People OK? How We Can Improve Heterosexuality” [Teen Vogue]. “Even though straight culture is understood as flawed, it’s still our society’s default, reinforced by everything from the wedding industrial complex to romantic comedies to Beyonce songs. We’re told by pop culture and capitalism alike that it is easier and safer to participate in straight culture than it is to be queer. Jane Ward, a professor of gender and sexuality at UC-Riverside and a lesbian who identifies as an ally to the straights, wants to change that presumption—but also our cynicism about the possibility of straight sex and love.” • “Identifies as an ally.” Is that the same as actually being an ally?

“One hundred years of ‘We'” [The New Criterion]. “Yevgeny Zamyatin wrote We in 1920, during the Russian Civil War. Composed at the dawn of the Soviet era—a not-so-distant mirror of our own troubled and dangerous times—We was first published in the USSR in 1988, at its dusk. The manuscript, a stunning prophecy of totalitarianism and a classic of dystopian literature, was one of several works that prompted a newspaper and magazine campaign against the author…. Zamyatin is among the few gifted twentieth-century writers who responded to ideological tyranny by poetically integrating mathematical science into a philosophical anthropology…. A trained scientist, Zamyatin designed and supervised the construction of icebreakers in England during the Great War. In We, mathematics (the language of the totalitarian OneState) and poetry (the language of its revolutionary opponents) are the antipodes around which humanly fundamental oppositions coalesce: necessity and freedom; order and chaos; entropy and energy; rationality and irrationality; utility and beauty; force and love; tameness and wildness; social totality and individual infinity. The drama of We plays out in the charged space between these poles: a field of electrical attraction and repulsion where opposites merge, unities split apart, and nothing stands still for long.”

Case numbers continue to climb, but Governor DeSantis’ office has not issued any new guidance. Experts say that lack of messaging could put those most vulnerable to the virus – specifically in the state’s long-term care facilities – even more at risk.

What You Need To Know DeSantis office has not issued new guidance as Florida’s case numbers climb



Aging Studies researcher says that puts vulnerable people at risk



Mayors are calling for a return to COVID restrictions

Florida’s coronavirus case count has surpassed 900,000, and data from the state shows a steady rise since the start of the month.

“This is to be expected,” said Dr. Lindsay Peterson, a researcher with USF’s School of Aging Studies. “The facilities aren’t in there generating COVID-19. COVID19 comes into these places from the outside.”

Peterson says community spread affects staff members who come and go from the facilities, and with Florida’s positivity rate for new cases now reaching more than 8 percent, she says messaging is key. Peterson said the public needs to be reminded through the holidays of the importance of social distancing, masks and remaining vigilant.

The FHCA, which represents more than 80% of long-term care facilities in the state, recently urged families to do just that.

But Peterson has her own take on that advice.

“It made me sad when the Florida Health Care Association sent out the news release asking the community to be careful over Thanksgiving,” Peterson said. “I feel like that messaging should also be coming from the government” – specifically from Governor Ron DeSantis.

Related Story FHCA Urges Cautious Holiday Approach for Long-Term Care Patients

Just yesterday, a group of Florida mayors, including St. Petersburg’s Rick Kriseman, urged the governor to require mask wearing statewide.

“It’s not a partisan issue,” Kriseman said. “This is not Republican or Democrat, red or blue.”

But, even if it’s not mandated, Peterson points again to the messaging, saying just encouragement from leaders can make a difference.

“We are social creatures, and we take our cues from the things we see and hear,” Peterson said. “And government does have a loud voice.”

Spectrum News reached out to Governor Ron DeSantis's office to find out if any new recommendations are planned ahead of the holidays, but has yet to hear back. His office has also not responded to requests for the governor’s reaction to the requests made by Florida mayors.Expert Says Governor's Lack of COVID Messaging Puts Vulnerable at Risk - Bay News 9<ol><li>Expert Says Governor's Lack of COVID Messaging Puts Vulnerable at Risk  Bay News 9

Oxford University says its coronavirus vaccine us up to 90% effectiveThe University of Oxford announced Monday a COVID-19 vaccine it's developed with AstraZeneca is 70.4% effective in preventing people from developing symptoms.Of note: The effectiveness of the vaccine increased to 90% among volunteers given half a dose, follow…The University of Oxford announced Monday that a COVID-19 vaccine it's developed with AstraZeneca is 70.4% effective in preventing people from developing symptoms, per interim data from Phase 3 trials.

Why it matters: The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is shown to work in different age groups and can be stored at fridge temperature. It is much cheaper than other vaccines in development and is part of the global COVAX initiative, designed to ensure doses go where they're most needed.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement that the vaccine's "simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval."

Between the lines: The findings come from combining results from two different dosing regimes.

When two full doses were given to volunteers at least a month apart, the efficacy was 62%. This rose to 90% among those given half a dose, followed by a full one, the university noted in a statement.

Pfizer and Moderna both reported earlier this month their coronavirus vaccines had efficacy rates of about 95%.

Yes, but: The Food and Drug Administration initially set the bar for a COVID-19 vaccine to be 50% effective, roughly in line with the seasonal flu vaccine. A 70% efficacy was a best-case scenario back then, per Axios' Marisa Fernandez.

For the record: More than 24,000 volunteers were involved in the trials in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa — including 131 coronavirus cases, per the university.

There were no hospitalizations nor severe cases of COVID-19 reported from participants treated with the vaccine.

Why it matters: The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is shown to work in different age groups and can be stored at fridge temperature. It is much cheaper than other vaccines in development and is part of the global COVAX initiative, designed to ensure doses go where they're most needed.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement that the vaccine's "simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available, supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval."

Between the lines: The findings come from combining results from two different dosing regimes.

When two full doses were given to volunteers at least a month apart, the efficacy was 62%. This rose to 90% among those given half a dose, followed by a full one, the university noted in a statement.

Pfizer and Moderna both reported earlier this month their coronavirus vaccines had efficacy rates of about 95%.

Yes, but: The Food and Drug Administration initially set the bar for a COVID-19 vaccine to be 50% effective, roughly in line with the seasonal flu vaccine. A 70% efficacy was a best-case scenario back then, per Axios' Marisa Fernandez.

For the record: More than 24,000 volunteers were involved in the trials in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa — including 131 coronavirus cases, per the university.

There were no hospitalizations nor severe cases of COVID-19 reported from participants treated with the vaccine.

What to expect: The university said in a statement scientists are "hoping to supply 3 billion doses of the vaccine and make it available to people around the world by the end of next year."

Chilean president says regulators okay AstraZeneca COVID vaccine trial - ReutersChilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Wednesday the country's health regulator had given the go-ahead for clinical trials of AstraZeneca PLC's COVID-19 vaccine.SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Wednesday the country’s health regulator had given the go-ahead for clinical trials of AstraZeneca PLC’s COVID-19 vaccine.

Pinera said the AstraZeneca trial would follow one by America’s Johnson & Johnson that is already underway and another by China’s Sinovac, whose first vaccine doses arrived in Chile on Wednesday.

He said Chile had been working “for months” to ensure sufficient and timely access to COVID vaccines, and hoped to start rolling them out to vulnerable populations “in the first few months of next year.”

“We all know that a safe, effective and readily-available vaccine to all those who need it will be a huge contribution to the fight against Coronavirus,” he said.

Pinera said Chile had signed a purchase agreement with Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE for 10 million doses of the vaccine they are jointly developing, and was working on similar agreements with AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Sinovac.

Chile’s government has previously said it had reserved 14.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and incorporated a clause into its agreement for the Sinovac trial for the preferential purchase of 20 million doses.

Pinera said Chile had also signed up “several weeks ago” to have access to 7.6 million vaccine doses through COVAX, an initiative led by the World Health Organization for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of eventual vaccines.

AstraZeneca, which is developing its COVID-19 vaccine along with the University of Oxford, paused its U.S. trial on Sept. 6 after a report of a serious neurological illness, believed to be transverse myelitis, in a participant in the company’s UK trial. The trial resumed in the US on Oct. 23.

Sinovac and Janssen trials in Chile were approved by the health regulator on September 30.

Also on Wednesday, Peru said Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca laboratories would begin trials of coronavirus vaccines in the country next week.

“Access to the vaccine against #COVID19 is a national objective,” the Peruvian Foreign Ministry said on Twitter.

Two weeks ago, Peru said it had withdrawn from signing a coronavirus vaccine purchase agreement with AstraZeneca because it did not provide data on its vaccine studies.Chilean president says regulators okay AstraZeneca COVID vaccine trial - ReutersChilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Wednesday the country's health regulator had given the go-ahead for clinical trials of AstraZeneca PLC's COVID-19 vaccine.SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Wednesday the country’s health regulator had given the go-ahead for clinical trials of AstraZeneca PLC’s COVID-19 vaccine.

Pfizer Announces Its COVID-19 Vaccine Is 90% EffectivePfizer and German biotech company, BioNTech, say they've developed a COVID-19 vaccine that's 90% effective at preventing the disease.
The post Pfizer Announces Its COVID-19 Vaccine Is 90% Effective appeared first on Nerdist.Pfizer and its German biotech partner, BioNTech, have just announced that their COVID-19 vaccine candidate is “90% effective” in preventing the disease in infected participants. If this estimate is borne out by future evidence, it would make the vaccine significantly more effective than current flu vaccines, and the first successful implementation of an RNA vaccine on this scale. The results from the trial on which this claim is based, however, have yet to be published, or peer reviewed.

UPDATE: We are proud to announce, along with @BioNTech_Group, that our mRNA-based #vaccine candidate has, at an interim analysis, demonstrated initial evidence of efficacy against #COVID19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. — Pfizer Inc. (@pfizer) November 9, 2020

The New York Times reported on Pfizer’s announcement. In a press release, the goliath pharmaceutical corporation said its RNA vaccine candidate, dubbed BNT162b2, prevented COVID-19 from developing in participants who were confirmed as infected with the virus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2. Meaning, it seems, that out of the 94 participants who’ve so far become infected with the virus, 90% of those who were infected after receiving the vaccine did not develop serious symptoms.

“Today is a great day for science and humanity,” Pfizer’s CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla, said in his company’s release. He added these results, which come from a Phase 3 clinical trial, provide “initial evidence” for the the vaccine’s efficacy.

Pfizer’s Phase 3 trial, which is ongoing, includes 43,538 participants from the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. To date, 38,955 of participants have received a placebo or a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2. Pfizer says it’s giving half the participants the placebo, and half the real vaccine.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla: "The vaccine will be available for free to all American citizens." pic.twitter.com/ucinomnLoQ — The Hill (@thehill) November 9, 2020

It does seem that all 94 of participants infected with the disease did experience at least mild symptoms, however. As Time reports, the ongoing clinical trial works by having participants proactively report COVID-19-like symptoms; these participants then go on to have themselves tested for SARS-CoV-2. This would mean that all 94 of these infected participants reported at least mild symptoms. (It’s unclear exactly how many of these 94 infected participants received the vaccine.)

If Pfizer’s vaccine is indeed 90% effective at preventing serious COVID symptoms, that would make it roughly 30 to 50% more effective than current flu vaccines. This would also mark the first time an RNA (or mRNA) vaccine has been shown to work on this scale. For those unfamiliar, an RNA vaccine—in this case—uses the RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to train a person’s cells to identify and make copies of the virus’ spike proteins. These spike proteins then train the body’s immune system to generate suitable antibodies.

In a video interview, Bourla said the vaccine will be “available for free to all American citizens,” although “free” is perhaps debatable. Bourla says Pfizer did not take part in Operation Warp Speed—the federal government’s effort to bring a vaccine to market. Although Pfizer still has a $1.95 billion federal contract to deliver 100 million doses to the American people.

U.S. Navy

Pfizer also still faces challenges before it can bring the vaccine to market. The corporation wants now to confirm 164 infection cases, and would like to let more time lapse post vaccine delivery; meaning it’d like to see how participants react to the real vaccine at least two months after their second doses.

Moving forward, Bourla says Pfizer could potentially produce 50 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020. And 1.3 billion doses by sometime in 2021. Again, however, the findings of this trial have yet to be peer reviewed. It should also be noted that in Pfizer’s Phase 2 clinical trial of BNT162b2, 17% of participants 18 to 55 years old and 8% of those 65 to 85 years old reported fevers above 100 °F. “Small numbers” of younger participants also had “severe systemic events” such as headache, chills, and muscle pain.

Bird Song of the Day

So that is a thrush!

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Here are the United States regions:

No sign of relief, sadly. (I don’t know what other strongly regional countries look like, but the first of our three stairsteps was in the Northeast, the second in the South, and to a lesser extent the West, and the third… everywhere. This pattern merits explanation, and I’m not sure I’ve seen it. Readers? Whatever our problems may be, we’re great at natural experiments!

Here are the Swing States as I conceive them (see below):

No changes.

“Trump’s path to victory narrows as Covid cases surge in Midwest” [Financial Times].

Here are positivity and mortality laid against confirmed cases:

“Trump’s path to victory narrows as Covid cases surge in Midwest” [Financial Times]. “But the president’s hopes of winning the upper Midwestern states that propelled him to victory in 2016 — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — have taken a blow in recent weeks as a third surge of Covid-19 cases ravages the region and focuses voters’ attention on his administration’s handling of the pandemic…. FT analysis shows that in battlegrounds where the number of Covid-19 cases has risen more than 7 per cent in the past week, Mr Biden has an average polling lead of 4.3 points. Conversely, Mr Biden’s lead in states where the rise in cases is 6 per cent or less is just 1.4 points.” Here is the FT chart:

The FT prose confirms my priors. But I’m not sure the chart confirms either. It has occured to me that an area that has already undergone the opioid epidemic and falling life expectancy might take Covid in stride. (This doesn’t explain the nationwide rise, of course.)

“Here are all the reasons COVID-19 cases are surging again” [MarketWatch]. The article is worth reading in full, but let me quote the reasons:

1. Falling temperatures mean more people are socializing indoors 2. People are dealing with “pandemic fatigue” 3. This translates to more social gatherings with extended family and friends 4. The return of college students in September is a likely culprit behind this wave of infections

And:

Thanksgiving, however, is going to be a critical holiday and one that is already stressing public health experts. (“The traditional Thanksgiving Day festivities have all the characteristics of the superspreader events,” [said Malia Jones, an epidemiologist and associate scientist in health geography at the University of Wisconsin–Madison] said.) It’s commonly spent indoors, with extended family that one doesn’t see on a daily basis and features a chatty meal that may stretch over several hours. “It’s one thing to say, I’m not going to get together with my family for Labor Day,” [Chris Meekins, director of health-care policy at Raymond James] said. “It’s a completely different level for a lot of folks to say, I’m not going to get together for Thanksgiving, or I’m not going to get together for Christmas.”

Worth noting that China scrapped New Years’ celebrations in January, and imposed a travel lockdown,

The election countdown:

Here is an early voting calendar. Maybe we’ll have a whole series of October surprises, since election day is gradually being devalued as an event.

And here are mail-in voting ruies, which naturally differ state by state.

“How to Vote in 2020: Everything You Need to Know” [Bloomberg]. “Casting a ballot in the U.S. isn’t always easy, with a complex web of varying state rules governing how and when you can vote. The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced even more complexity in 2020, as many states have made significant changes to allow for more early voting or voting by mail. More changes could come as lawsuits in several states wind their way through the courts. That’s why Bloomberg News is answering these critical questions so you’ll know what you need to do to make sure your vote is counted in the 2020 election.”

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

GDP: “Advance Estimate 3Q2020 GDP Shows Record Improvement” [Econintersect]. “The advance estimate for third-quarter 2020 Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a positive 31.4%. This growth is a significant improvement from the previous quarter’s decline of 31.4 % if one looks at quarter-over-quarter headline growth. The year-over-year rate of growth also significantly improved but remains in contraction….. I am not a fan of quarter-over-quarter exaggerated method of measuring GDP – but the recovery from the pandemic is not over as the year-over-year GDP growth remains in contraction.”

Employment Situation: “24 October 2020 Initial Unemployment Claims Improve” [Econintersect]. “The more important (because of the volatility in the weekly reported claims and seasonality errors in adjusting the data) 4 week moving average moved from 812,250 (reported last week as 811,250) to 787,750… The four-week rolling average of initial claims is 266 % higher than one year ago (versus the 277 % higher last week).” • Modified rapture….

Rail: “Rail Week Ending 24 October 2020 – Modest Improvement Continues” [Econintersect]. “Total rail traffic has been mostly in contraction for over one year – and now is slowly recovering from the coronavirus pandemic…. Container exports from China are now recovering, container exports from the U.S. remains deep in contraction. This week again intermodal continued in expansion year-over-year and continues on a strengthening trendline. However, carloads remain in contraction. But overall, rail is on an improving trendline.”

Mr. Market: “Dow swings over 100 points higher Thursday as investors parse U.S. GDP’s record third-quarter rise” [MarketWatch]. “U.S. stock gauges on Thursday were trying to claw back at least a portion of yesterday’s rout for the broader market, as investors digested a preliminary reading of the health of the U.S. economy that indicated a massive rebound in growth from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, albeit off an economic base that had shrunk considerably….. Investors fear a tight race that could produce a contested election outcome, potentially leading to weeks of uncertainty and acrimony, while a more clear-cut outcome is seen paving the way for near-term spending to aid the economy.” • I remember in 2000, during Bush v. Gore, the word was “closure,” and I assume everybody was craved that because our famously entrepreneural and steel-nerved investment community hates uncertainty…

The Biosphere

“A Scientist Who Delights in the Mundane” (interview) [Quanta Magazine]. L. Mahadevan: “While visiting an agricultural college in Bangalore [India] in 2009, I saw a termite mound for the first time during a stroll through campus. I knew little about them but decided it would be a cool thing to study. Termites are considered among the greatest architects on Earth. A couple of years ago, a network of termite mounds in Brazil was discovered that is as large as Great Britain. Inside each mound, which is a few meters tall, millions of millimeter-sized termites live. That’s comparable to humans living in buildings a few kilometers high. The mounds are built to harness the environment — places where temperature, humidity and gas concentrations are well controlled. We have studied the function of termite mounds in both India and Namibia, and most recently have begun to understand the principles of how they are built. Our experiments showed that the mound operates like a lung, breathing once a day in response to external temperature changes. And we have a mathematical model that shows how the mound geometry, environmental conditions and termite behavior are all interrelated.”

“Integrated Single-Cell Atlases Reveal an Oral SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Axis” (preprint) [medRxiv]. This is super-interesting, looks really good to me, and is well worth a read by our epidemiologists; I really can’t excerpt it properly. From the abstract: “Despite signs of infection, the involvement of the oral cavity in COVID-19 is poorly understood….. COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in vivo SARS CoV-2 infection in the salivary glands and mucosa…. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and viral burden in saliva correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss. Upon recovery, this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19 infection andimplicates saliva in viral transmission.”

Here is the three stair-step pattern again:

“It may be time to reset expectations on when we’ll get a Covid-19 vaccine” [STAT]. “he ambitious drive to produce Covid-19 vaccine at warp speed seems to be running up against reality. We all probably need to reset our expectations about how quickly we’re going to be able to be vaccinated. Pauses in clinical trials to investigate potential safety issues, a slower-than-expected rate of infections among participants in at least one of the trials, and signals that an expert panel advising the Food and Drug Administration may not be comfortable recommending use of vaccines on very limited safety and efficacy data appear to be adding up to a slippage in the estimates of when vaccine will be ready to be deployed. Asked Wednesday about when he expects the FDA will greenlight use of the first vaccines, Anthony Fauci moved the administration’s stated goalpost. ‘Could be January, could be later. We don’t know,’ Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an online interview with JAMA editor Howard Bauchner.”

“Ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating viral particles in cellular models” (preprint) [bioRxiv]. These dudes put a patent on this. Nevertheless, from the Abstract: “Here we report that ethacridine, a safe and potent antiseptic use in humans, effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2, at very low concentrations (EC50 ~ 0.08 μM). Ethacridine was identified through a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library in living cells using a fluorescent assay. Interestingly, the main mode of action of ethacridine is to inactivate virus particles, preventing binding to the host cells. Thus, our work has identified a potent drug with a distinct mode of action against SARS-CoV-2.” • Readers know I like repurposing existing, proven drugs.

Class Warfare

“Men Build Up Placid Surfaces That Women Puncture” (reprint) [David Graeber, Delancey Place]. “Women may have regularly deferred to men as the authoritative voices for representing the community, but as often as not, they would push the men on stage only to subvert their message as soon as they were done with it. Even the old woman who took me to her son to narrate vil­lage history ended up interrupting him, as soon as he was drawing to a close, to tell the story of a notorious local witch — completely shattering the image of solidarity he had just done his best to convey, and causing much consterna­tion among the assembled menfolk. Things like this happened again and again. At times it seemed to take on an almost ritualized cast. In the end, I came to conclusion that it was this very process — men building up the placid surfaces that women would then mischievously puncture and expose — that history and moral discourse really consisted of. The object only existed when it had been halfway ripped apart. … Many argue that all societies distinguish between a public sphere identified especially with men, and domestic sphere, identified especially with women; and that one way that women are suppressed is by being denied full access to the public arena. Bloch argues [Madagascar] is no exception. But one extension of the ritualized nature of public discourse in [Madagascar] is that — as I have already pointed out at some length — authoritative men tend to avoid displays or references to conflict, so that it is especially women who voice it, just as it is especially women who are publicly critical of established verities.”

“The Incredible Story of the Great Cannonball Boom” [GQ]. “On the outside, his Mustang looked pretty much like any other car on the road. Inside was another story. Splayed across Ashmore’s dashboard was an array of devices, including a CB radio, a mounted tablet operating Waze and Google Maps, and an iPhone running a timer. Stuck to the inside of the windshield was a radar detector; on the front grille and back bumper were the sensors for a laser jammer. Even more conspicuously, strapped beside and behind Ashmore, where the front and rear passenger seats should have been, huge fuel tanks sloshed with gasoline. A series of hoses connected them—along with another enormous tank, this one in the trunk—to the car’s main fuel tank. An officer inspecting Ashmore’s rig could have been forgiven for concluding that he was driving a giant gasoline bomb.” • This was a rented Mustang. A terrific story that reminds us how enormous this country is.

Bird Song of the Day

So that is a thrush!

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Here are the United States regions:

No sign of relief, sadly. (I don’t know what other strongly regional countries look like, but the first of our three stairsteps was in the Northeast, the second in the South, and to a lesser extent the West, and the third… everywhere. This pattern merits explanation, and I’m not sure I’ve seen it. Readers? Whatever our problems may be, we’re great at natural experiments!

Here are the Swing States as I conceive them (see below):

No changes.

“Trump’s path to victory narrows as Covid cases surge in Midwest” [Financial Times].

Here are positivity and mortality laid against confirmed cases:

“Trump’s path to victory narrows as Covid cases surge in Midwest” [Financial Times]. “But the president’s hopes of winning the upper Midwestern states that propelled him to victory in 2016 — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — have taken a blow in recent weeks as a third surge of Covid-19 cases ravages the region and focuses voters’ attention on his administration’s handling of the pandemic…. FT analysis shows that in battlegrounds where the number of Covid-19 cases has risen more than 7 per cent in the past week, Mr Biden has an average polling lead of 4.3 points. Conversely, Mr Biden’s lead in states where the rise in cases is 6 per cent or less is just 1.4 points.” Here is the FT chart:

The FT prose confirms my priors. But I’m not sure the chart confirms either. It has occured to me that an area that has already undergone the opioid epidemic and falling life expectancy might take Covid in stride. (This doesn’t explain the nationwide rise, of course.)

“Here are all the reasons COVID-19 cases are surging again” [MarketWatch]. The article is worth reading in full, but let me quote the reasons:

1. Falling temperatures mean more people are socializing indoors 2. People are dealing with “pandemic fatigue” 3. This translates to more social gatherings with extended family and friends 4. The return of college students in September is a likely culprit behind this wave of infections

And:

Thanksgiving, however, is going to be a critical holiday and one that is already stressing public health experts. (“The traditional Thanksgiving Day festivities have all the characteristics of the superspreader events,” [said Malia Jones, an epidemiologist and associate scientist in health geography at the University of Wisconsin–Madison] said.) It’s commonly spent indoors, with extended family that one doesn’t see on a daily basis and features a chatty meal that may stretch over several hours. “It’s one thing to say, I’m not going to get together with my family for Labor Day,” [Chris Meekins, director of health-care policy at Raymond James] said. “It’s a completely different level for a lot of folks to say, I’m not going to get together for Thanksgiving, or I’m not going to get together for Christmas.”

Worth noting that China scrapped New Years’ celebrations in January, and imposed a travel lockdown,

The election countdown:

Here is an early voting calendar. Maybe we’ll have a whole series of October surprises, since election day is gradually being devalued as an event.

And here are mail-in voting ruies, which naturally differ state by state.

“2020 General Election Early Vote Statistics” [U.S. Elections Project (SlayTheSmaugs)].

“How to Vote in 2020: Everything You Need to Know” [Bloomberg]. “Casting a ballot in the U.S. isn’t always easy, with a complex web of varying state rules governing how and when you can vote. The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced even more complexity in 2020, as many states have made significant changes to allow for more early voting or voting by mail. More changes could come as lawsuits in several states wind their way through the courts. That’s why Bloomberg News is answering these critical questions so you’ll know what you need to do to make sure your vote is counted in the 2020 election.”

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

GDP: “Advance Estimate 3Q2020 GDP Shows Record Improvement” [Econintersect]. “The advance estimate for third-quarter 2020 Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a positive 31.4%. This growth is a significant improvement from the previous quarter’s decline of 31.4 % if one looks at quarter-over-quarter headline growth. The year-over-year rate of growth also significantly improved but remains in contraction….. I am not a fan of quarter-over-quarter exaggerated method of measuring GDP – but the recovery from the pandemic is not over as the year-over-year GDP growth remains in contraction.”

Employment Situation: “24 October 2020 Initial Unemployment Claims Improve” [Econintersect]. “The more important (because of the volatility in the weekly reported claims and seasonality errors in adjusting the data) 4 week moving average moved from 812,250 (reported last week as 811,250) to 787,750… The four-week rolling average of initial claims is 266 % higher than one year ago (versus the 277 % higher last week).” • Modified rapture….

Rail: “Rail Week Ending 24 October 2020 – Modest Improvement Continues” [Econintersect]. “Total rail traffic has been mostly in contraction for over one year – and now is slowly recovering from the coronavirus pandemic…. Container exports from China are now recovering, container exports from the U.S. remains deep in contraction. This week again intermodal continued in expansion year-over-year and continues on a strengthening trendline. However, carloads remain in contraction. But overall, rail is on an improving trendline.”

Mr. Market: “Dow swings over 100 points higher Thursday as investors parse U.S. GDP’s record third-quarter rise” [MarketWatch]. “U.S. stock gauges on Thursday were trying to claw back at least a portion of yesterday’s rout for the broader market, as investors digested a preliminary reading of the health of the U.S. economy that indicated a massive rebound in growth from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, albeit off an economic base that had shrunk considerably….. Investors fear a tight race that could produce a contested election outcome, potentially leading to weeks of uncertainty and acrimony, while a more clear-cut outcome is seen paving the way for near-term spending to aid the economy.” • I remember in 2000, during Bush v. Gore, the word was “closure,” and I assume everybody was craved that because our famously entrepreneural and steel-nerved investment community hates uncertainty…

The Biosphere

“A Scientist Who Delights in the Mundane” (interview) [Quanta Magazine]. L. Mahadevan: “While visiting an agricultural college in Bangalore [India] in 2009, I saw a termite mound for the first time during a stroll through campus. I knew little about them but decided it would be a cool thing to study. Termites are considered among the greatest architects on Earth. A couple of years ago, a network of termite mounds in Brazil was discovered that is as large as Great Britain. Inside each mound, which is a few meters tall, millions of millimeter-sized termites live. That’s comparable to humans living in buildings a few kilometers high. The mounds are built to harness the environment — places where temperature, humidity and gas concentrations are well controlled. We have studied the function of termite mounds in both India and Namibia, and most recently have begun to understand the principles of how they are built. Our experiments showed that the mound operates like a lung, breathing once a day in response to external temperature changes. And we have a mathematical model that shows how the mound geometry, environmental conditions and termite behavior are all interrelated.”

“Integrated Single-Cell Atlases Reveal an Oral SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Axis” (preprint) [medRxiv]. This is super-interesting, looks really good to me, and is well worth a read by our epidemiologists; I really can’t excerpt it properly. From the abstract: “Despite signs of infection, the involvement of the oral cavity in COVID-19 is poorly understood….. COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in vivo SARS CoV-2 infection in the salivary glands and mucosa…. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and viral burden in saliva correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss. Upon recovery, this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19 infection andimplicates saliva in viral transmission.”

Here is the three stair-step pattern again:

“It may be time to reset expectations on when we’ll get a Covid-19 vaccine” [STAT]. “he ambitious drive to produce Covid-19 vaccine at warp speed seems to be running up against reality. We all probably need to reset our expectations about how quickly we’re going to be able to be vaccinated. Pauses in clinical trials to investigate potential safety issues, a slower-than-expected rate of infections among participants in at least one of the trials, and signals that an expert panel advising the Food and Drug Administration may not be comfortable recommending use of vaccines on very limited safety and efficacy data appear to be adding up to a slippage in the estimates of when vaccine will be ready to be deployed. Asked Wednesday about when he expects the FDA will greenlight use of the first vaccines, Anthony Fauci moved the administration’s stated goalpost. ‘Could be January, could be later. We don’t know,’ Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an online interview with JAMA editor Howard Bauchner.”

“Ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating viral particles in cellular models” (preprint) [bioRxiv]. These dudes put a patent on this. Nevertheless, from the Abstract: “Here we report that ethacridine, a safe and potent antiseptic use in humans, effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2, at very low concentrations (EC50 ~ 0.08 μM). Ethacridine was identified through a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library in living cells using a fluorescent assay. Interestingly, the main mode of action of ethacridine is to inactivate virus particles, preventing binding to the host cells. Thus, our work has identified a potent drug with a distinct mode of action against SARS-CoV-2.” • Readers know I like repurposing existing, proven drugs.

Class Warfare

“Men Build Up Placid Surfaces That Women Puncture” (reprint) [David Graeber, Delancey Place]. “Women may have regularly deferred to men as the authoritative voices for representing the community, but as often as not, they would push the men on stage only to subvert their message as soon as they were done with it. Even the old woman who took me to her son to narrate vil­lage history ended up interrupting him, as soon as he was drawing to a close, to tell the story of a notorious local witch — completely shattering the image of solidarity he had just done his best to convey, and causing much consterna­tion among the assembled menfolk. Things like this happened again and again. At times it seemed to take on an almost ritualized cast. In the end, I came to conclusion that it was this very process — men building up the placid surfaces that women would then mischievously puncture and expose — that history and moral discourse really consisted of. The object only existed when it had been halfway ripped apart. … Many argue that all societies distinguish between a public sphere identified especially with men, and domestic sphere, identified especially with women; and that one way that women are suppressed is by being denied full access to the public arena. Bloch argues [Madagascar] is no exception. But one extension of the ritualized nature of public discourse in [Madagascar] is that — as I have already pointed out at some length — authoritative men tend to avoid displays or references to conflict, so that it is especially women who voice it, just as it is especially women who are publicly critical of established verities.”

News of the Wired

“The Incredible Story of the Great Cannonball Boom” [GQ]. “On the outside, his Mustang looked pretty much like any other car on the road. Inside was another story. Splayed across Ashmore’s dashboard was an array of devices, including a CB radio, a mounted tablet operating Waze and Google Maps, and an iPhone running a timer. Stuck to the inside of the windshield was a radar detector; on the front grille and back bumper were the sensors for a laser jammer. Even more conspicuously, strapped beside and behind Ashmore, where the front and rear passenger seats should have been, huge fuel tanks sloshed with gasoline. A series of hoses connected them—along with another enormous tank, this one in the trunk—to the car’s main fuel tank. An officer inspecting Ashmore’s rig could have been forgiven for concluding that he was driving a giant gasoline bomb.” • This was a rented Mustang. A terrific story that reminds us how enormous this country is.

Karnataka Health and Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar Tuesday suspended a lab technician and an ASHA worker for allegedly issuing false Covid-19 negative reports at a hospital in Bengaluru.

Confirming the same, Sudhakar said he was apprised of the situation by various media reports that emerged recently pointing out the irregularities at Pobbathi Maternity Hospital at V V Puram in the city.

“A team of health officers led by the jurisdictional BBMP Joint Commissioner was sent to the hospital for inspection immediately, after which the irregularities were found to be confirmed. An FIR will be registered against the lab technician who was on contract and the ASHA worker who were issuing negative Covid-19 reports,” the Minister said.

"FIR to be registered as well," he added. @IndianExpress pic.twitter.com/4kcogQ9ajt — Ralph Alex Arakal (@ralpharakal) October 27, 2020

In the wake of the incident, Sudhakar said strict regulations would be introduced to rectify loopholes in the functioning of the system in place, including places within the limits of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city’s local civic body.

‘Vaccine to reach across Karnataka, corona warriors to get vaccinated first’

Further, when asked about the Karnataka government’s plan to distribute Covid-19 vaccine in the state, the Sudhakar said, “A technical committee comprising health experts, epidemiologists, technology partners, and logistical partners with the assistance of the Union Health Ministry will ensure that the vaccine reaches the nook and corner of the state.”

He further said ‘corona warriors’, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, support staff, and healthcare workers, would be the first beneficiaries of the vaccine followed by senior citizens, patients with co-morbidities, and lactating mothers among others. “A final decision on this will be taken within a week,” he said.

Test positivity rate in population shows Covid-19 isn’t contained: Priyank Kharge

Senior Congress leader and former minister Priyank Kharge Tuesday dismissed the BJP-led state government’s claims of performing well in containing the coronavirus pandemic, saying that the highest infection rate in India is in Bengaluru. “The test positivity rate is 12.5 per cent in Bengaluru. Covid-19 infection in the city has risen from 1.6 per cent to 2.6 per cent in a month now,” he said.

Further, taking to Twitter, the legislator from Chittapur constituency in Kalaburagi alleged that the government “has abandoned” towns and rural areas. “In rural areas test results are taking more than a week. The next spike will be in towns where cases are already underreported,” he said.

As of Monday, most active cases in the state apart from Bengaluru Urban were noted to be at Bengaluru Rural (3602), Dakshina Kannada (2427), Tumkur (2193), and Mysuru (2157).

California Covid-19 Update: Governor Gavin Newsom Reveals State’s Vaccine Distribution TimelineThe seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic came home to California Governor Gavin Newsom this weekend when he and his family had to quarantine after his children were exposed to the virus. The governor said his entire family had tested negative. “I feel perfect…The seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic came home to California Gov. Gavin Newsom this weekend when he and his family had to quarantine after his children were exposed to the virus. The governor said his entire family had tested negative. “I feel perfectly healthy,” he said but indicated that he would continue quarantining.

The state announced its highest-ever number of new daily cases over the weekend, with an eye-popping 15,442 on Saturday. That shatters the record of 13,000-plus recorded on Friday and cemented the notion that California is in the midst of a record-breaking new surge.

#COVID19 UPDATE: This last week, CA saw an unprecedented rise in cases.



– Average daily tests: 198,379 – Average test positivity rate: 5.5% – Daily case average: 11,591 – Hospitalizations: up 77% over last 2 weeks – ICU: up 55% over last 2 weeks — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) November 23, 2020

In light of that, Newsom spent much of Monday’s presentation on California’s plan for vaccines. “I wanted to take the veil off,” he said.

The governor said the mass vaccinations for Covid-19 would “build off” experience the state has had with flu, SARS and H1N1, noting that the state delivers 19 million flu vaccinations annually. It does some within a 90- to 120-day period every year, he said.

Related Story Daily Coronavirus Deaths Are On The Rise In Los Angeles; Calculated To Triple Over Next Few Weeks

“The first tranche of vaccinations will be extraordinarily limited,” Newsom said, adding, “We’ve been working for months” to devise a distribution strategy.

The state will be prioritizing health care workers, first responders and those in congregate healthcare settings. Phase 1a of state’s distribution plan is to prioritize state’s 2.4 million healthcare workers. There is some concern that California might not get that many doses at first. Newsom said the state is planning for that as well.

Phase 1 distribution recommendations will be ready for review by December 1, said Newsom.

Planning for Phase 2 and 3 will roll out beginning to mid-January, according to the governor. Mass distribution is a long way off, he warned.

The state is anticipating FDA approval of the first two vaccines in early December, according to Newsom. It will be “March, April, May, June, July where we start to scale and get into some of these subsequent phases,” he revealed.

As far as the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, state health officials have reviewed their Phase 1 and Phase 2 data. Newsom promised that the state will expedite the review of Phase 3 findings to turn a decision around in 24 hours. The governor also recognized AstraZeneca’s promising new vaccine but did not discuss detailed plans around it.

He said the biggest problem lay with Pfizer’s vaccines, which must be stored at -70 Celsius. The state is working on dozens of ultralow-temperature freezers, but transport is the most difficult part of the plan with Pfizer, Newsom said.

The state has acquired 16 such ultra-cold freezers, which range in cost from $10,000-$15,000, and is distributing them. A number of “mini freezers” will be sent to smaller counties such as Mono and Siskyu as well as urban areas “with an equity lens.”

Even given the associated costs, “We’re not waiting for anything. We’ll find the resources,” said Newsom.

He noted that the state has received $20 million from the CDC — with $6 million of that going to local health staffing and $10 million being spent on local health planning. But the federal government needs to step up much, much more in terms of financial support,” Newsom said.

Mentioning the money appropriated for states earlier this year, Newsom said the “second round needs to be substantially more.”

In light of the unprecedented, rapid rise in COVID-19 across California, Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced a limited stay-at-home order. It requires “generally that non-essential work, movement and gatherings stop between 10 PM and 5 AM in counties in the purple tier.” That means basically every county in Southern California and 94% of the state’s population.

“We’ve seen an unprecedented number and new rise in cases of Covid,” said Newsom on Monday.

He announced the state had seen 8,337 new cases to start the week. The 7-day average was a staggering 11,597. That means California is now averaging daily what had once been the all-time record from July. That was 12,807 in July 22.

The state delivered a record daily number of tests over the weekend with 265,000 in Saturday. Even with that, however, the state’s average test positivity rate is still rising, meaning the virus is spreading and the numbers are greater than what was been found thusfar. The 14 day positivity rate is 5.5% on Monday. It was just 4.8% last week. The 7-day test positivity rate is even higher, at 5.8%. That means the 14-day rate is likely to rise further.

“The 18-49 age cohort now represents 60% of all out cases.” That age cohort accounts for 7% of deaths, according to the state’s top health officer, Dr. Mark Ghaly. While it’s great deaths aren’t higher, that means more people are walking around spreading the virus.

Newsom said 5,459 new hospitalizations had been recorded. Covid-related illnesses now are 7% of the entire hospital capacity — a 77% increase over two weeks, he said.

Over that same period, there had been a 55% increase in virus patients occupying ICU beds, Ghaly said. Such patients now account for 17% of all ICU beds.

“Hospitals are already seeing the impact of the surge,” Ghaly said, before indicating that the stress on hospitals is the “highest that it’s ever been,” according to a state hospital census.

Newsom announced early last week that he was beginning to implement the state plan to surge ICU beds, beginning with hard-hit Imperial County. One big issue, however, is not the beds but staffing. ICU-trained nurses are in short supply and they cannot be trained in a short period of time. That means the state’s greatest challenge, especially as healthcare workers get sick, might be staffing.

The limited stay at home order is designed to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. Activities conducted during 10 p.m.-5 a.m. often are non-essential, according to the governor’s office, and more likely related to social activities. Those types of gatherings have a higher likelihood of leading to reduced inhibition and reduced likelihood for adherence to safety measures like wearing a face covering and maintaining physical distance.

“There’s a lot of exemptions,” he said. Deadline reported on Friday that film and TV production workers are among the exemptions.

Newsom said the stay-at-mome order would last until December 21, but could be extended. “We’ll see. We’re open-minded,” he said.

California’s Director of Health and Human Services, Dr. Mark Ghaly warned last week that if the surge does not stop, “All tools are on the table. We will explore further restrictions” if the tide cannot be turned.

The governor said his entire family had tested negative. “I feel perfect…The seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic came home to California Gov. Gavin Newsom this weekend when he and his family had to quarantine after his children were exposed to the virus. The governor said his entire family had tested negative. “I feel perfectly healthy,” he said but indicated that he would continue quarantining.

The state announced its highest-ever number of new daily cases over the weekend, with an eye-popping 15,442 on Saturday. That shatters the record of 13,000-plus recorded on Friday and cemented the notion that California is in the midst of a record-breaking new surge.

#COVID19 UPDATE: This last week, CA saw an unprecedented rise in cases.



– Average daily tests: 198,379 – Average test positivity rate: 5.5% – Daily case average: 11,591 – Hospitalizations: up 77% over last 2 weeks – ICU: up 55% over last 2 weeks — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) November 23, 2020

In light of that, Newsom spent much of Monday’s presentation on California’s plan for vaccines. “I wanted to take the veil off,” he said.

The governor said the mass vaccinations for Covid-19 would “build off” experience the state has had with flu, SARS and H1N1, noting that the state delivers 19 million flu vaccinations annually. It does some within a 90- to 120-day period every year, he said.

“The first tranche of vaccinations will be extraordinarily limited,” Newsom said, adding, “We’ve been working for months” to devise a distribution strategy.

The state will be prioritizing health care workers, first responders and those in congregate healthcare settings. Phase 1a of state’s distribution plan is to prioritize state’s 2.4 million healthcare workers. There is some concern that California might not get that many doses at first. Newsom said the state is planning for that as well.

Phase 1 distribution recommendations will be ready for review by December 1, said Newsom.

Planning for Phase 2 and 3 will roll out beginning to mid-January, according to the governor. Mass distribution is a long way off, he warned.

The state is anticipating FDA approval of the first two vaccines in early December, according to Newsom. It will be “March, April, May, June, July where we start to scale and get into some of these subsequent phases,” he revealed.

As far as the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, state health officials have reviewed their Phase 1 and Phase 2 data. Newsom promised that the state will expedite the review of Phase 3 findings to turn a decision around in 24 hours. The governor also recognized AstraZeneca’s promising new vaccine but did not discuss detailed plans around it.

He said the biggest problem lay with Pfizer’s vaccines, which must be stored at -70 Celsius. The state is working on dozens of ultralow-temperature freezers, but transport is the most difficult part of the plan with Pfizer, Newsom said.

The state has acquired 16 such ultra-cold freezers, which range in cost from $10,000-$15,000, and is distributing them. A number of “mini freezers” will be sent to smaller counties such as Mono and Siskyu as well as urban areas “with an equity lens.”

Even given the associated costs, “We’re not waiting for anything. We’ll find the resources,” said Newsom.

He noted that the state has received $20 million from the CDC — with $6 million of that going to local health staffing and $10 million being spent on local health planning. But the federal government needs to step up much, much more in terms of financial support,” Newsom said.

Mentioning the money appropriated for states earlier this year, Newsom said the “second round needs to be substantially more.”

In light of the unprecedented, rapid rise in COVID-19 across California, Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced a limited stay-at-home order. It requires “generally that non-essential work, movement and gatherings stop between 10 PM and 5 AM in counties in the purple tier.” That means basically every county in Southern California and 94% of the state’s population.

“We’ve seen an unprecedented number and new rise in cases of Covid,” said Newsom on Monday.

He announced the state had seen 8,337 new cases to start the week. The 7-day average was a staggering 11,597. That means California is now averaging daily what had once been the all-time record from July. That was 12,807 in July 22.

The state delivered a record daily number of tests over the weekend with 265,000 in Saturday. Even with that, however, the state’s average test positivity rate is still rising, meaning the virus is spreading and the numbers are greater than what was been found thusfar. The 14 day positivity rate is 5.5% on Monday. It was just 4.8% last week. The 7-day test positivity rate is even higher, at 5.8%. That means the 14-day rate is likely to rise further.

“The 18-49 age cohort now represents 60% of all out cases.” That age cohort accounts for 7% of deaths, according to the state’s top health officer, Dr. Mark Ghaly. While it’s great deaths aren’t higher, that means more people are walking around spreading the virus.

Newsom said 5,459 new hospitalizations had been recorded. Covid-related illnesses now are 7% of the entire hospital capacity — a 77% increase over two weeks, he said.

Over that same period, there had been a 55% increase in virus patients occupying ICU beds, Ghaly said. Such patients now account for 17% of all ICU beds.

“Hospitals are already seeing the impact of the surge,” Ghaly said, before indicating that the stress on hospitals is the “highest that it’s ever been,” according to a state hospital census.

Newsom announced early last week that he was beginning to implement the state plan to surge ICU beds, beginning with hard-hit Imperial County. One big issue, however, is not the beds but staffing. ICU-trained nurses are in short supply and they cannot be trained in a short period of time. That means the state’s greatest challenge, especially as healthcare workers get sick, might be staffing.

The limited stay at home order is designed to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. Activities conducted during 10 p.m.-5 a.m. often are non-essential, according to the governor’s office, and more likely related to social activities. Those types of gatherings have a higher likelihood of leading to reduced inhibition and reduced likelihood for adherence to safety measures like wearing a face covering and maintaining physical distance.

“There’s a lot of exemptions,” he said. Deadline reported on Friday that film and TV production workers are among the exemptions.

Newsom said the stay-at-mome order would last until December 21, but could be extended. “We’ll see. We’re open-minded,” he said.

California’s Director of Health and Human Services, Dr. Mark Ghaly warned last week that if the surge does not stop, “All tools are on the table. We will explore further restrictions” if the tide cannot be turned.

A Life-and-Death Election Like No OtherOne candidate has a plan to fight Covid-19. The other still won't acknowledge the scale of the problemWASHINGTON — Here are three numbers to bear in mind on the eve of this election:

31.

99,000.

2.1 million.

The first — 31 — is the number of states that set a new one-day record for Covid-19 infections at some point during the month of October.

The second — 99,000 — is the number of new Covid-19 infections recorded nationwide on Friday, October 30th, a new single-day record for new cases in the U.S.

The third — 2.1 million — is the high-end estimate for how many Americans would die if the country embraced herd immunity to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a September 2020 analysis by two French experts in epidemiology and infectious disease modeling. The low-end mortality estimate, those researchers say, is 500,000.

With these three figures you can see the story of the utter failure by President Trump and his administration to implement a coherent, consistent national plan to stop Covid-19. We are now almost nine months into the worst pandemic since the 1918-19 Spanish flu. New cases are soaring, not diminishing. The second wave that Vice President Mike Pence assured us in May wasn’t real has in fact come and gone, and the country has now entered a third wave — or depending how you look at it, the first wave has yet to recede. The pandemic is worsening, not improving, and in the northern states, as winter arrives, the cold weather will make it that much harder to socially distance and slow the virus’s spread.

And how has the Trump administration responded? Apart from fast-tracking a vaccine, Trump has given up. There is no concerted federal response to slow and eventually stop the pandemic; there never really was in the first place. Even Trump’s own chief of staff, Mark Meadows, concedes that the White House has all but given up. “We are not going to control the pandemic,” he recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics, and other mitigation areas.”

Even more worrisome, recent news reports suggest Trump has warmed up to the idea of herd immunity as a way to deal with the virus. If you’re unfamiliar with herd immunity, here’s the basic idea: If you stop trying to contain the virus and instead let it run rampant through a population, enough people will get infected and develop an immunity that the virus will eventually spread more slowly and peter out.

To call this a risky strategy would be an understatement. Wide-scale herd immunity is an untested method that, according to projections, could lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. Many public-health experts say it is tantamount to surrendering to the virus, a collective throwing up of the hands, a grim wave of the white flag. “We have never successfully been able to do it before, and it will lead to unacceptable and unnecessary untold human death and suffering,” Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, told Nature in October.

Still, the Financial Times and Daily Beast have recently reported that Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in epidemiology who Trump appointed to the White House Coronavirus Task Force while marginalizing actual experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci or Dr. Deborah Birx, has consulted with experts about herd immunity and promoted the idea within the administration. (Atlas and a White House spokeswoman denied this to the Beast.) And Trump himself appeared to acknowledge, if not endorse, herd immunity during an ABC News town hall last month when he said the virus would go away without a vaccine “over a period of time” with a “herd mentality,” apparently meaning herd immunity.

‼️@realDonaldTrump claims the #coronavirus “is going away,” yet 200,000 Americans have died.@GStephanopoulos: Without a #vaccine? TRUMP: Sure—over a period of time S: And many deaths TRUMP: Like a herd mentality, It's gonna be herd developed.😳pic.twitter.com/R1LUzTgXYZ — Dena Grayson, MD, PhD (@DrDenaGrayson) September 16, 2020

But you don’t have to speculate about Trump’s support for herd immunity to see his disregard for the severity of the pandemic. Look no further than his insistence on holding rallies attended by tens of thousands of densely packed supporters, many of whom, taking a cue from the president, declined to wear masks. A team of researchers out of Stanford University published a working paper last week that estimated that 18 of the president’s rallies held this year led to an additional 30,000 coronavirus cases and 700 deaths. And on the campaign trail, Trump gives a few scant mentions of the pandemic in his stump, mostly to dismiss it citing his own infection and that of his family. “It’s ending anyway,” he claimed at a rally in Pennsylvania last weekend.

This is the Trump administration’s approach to a public-health calamity that has claimed the lives of a quarter-million Americans and counting. An approach of betting it all on rapidly developing a vaccine while flirting with unproven ideas like herd immunity. A blithe dismissal of the disproportionate effect of the virus on black and brown communities, and a magical thinking that it will simply go away on its own. “Somehow, [the Republican Party] decided that #COVID19 was a non-issue,” Gregg Gonsalves, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health and an expert in infectious disease, put it. “Easiest way to re-election was to succeed in containing the epidemic. They made an explicit choice not to, to sit on their hands while people died in the tens of thousands. If this election is about anything it’s about this.”

An old cliché gets passed around every two or four years: “Vote like your life depends on it.” But it’s never rang more true and felt more real than it does right now.

At the top of the ballot are two visions for combating this pandemic that couldn’t be more different. On one side is a president who still believes the virus will melt away on its own, who refuses to take blame and insists this is all China’s fault, who sneers at science and evidence and expertise unless it makes him look good and brings news he wants to hear. And on the other side is a candidate who vows to “listen to the scientists,” who along with some of our nation’s top scientists supports a national mask mandate, and who claims he would double the number of tests conducted weekly, establish a Pandemic Testing Board to manage the scaled-up test production, and launch a 100,000-person national contact-tracing corps.

Joe Biden’s Covid-19 plan is just that, a plan. Words on paper. If he wins, he’ll need to be held accountable to all of it. But he is the only presidential candidate with a plan to get us out of a public-health nightmare that only seems to be getting worse. That fact alone is worth remembering in this election. Vote like your life depends on it indeed.

New York AG threatens Trump with lawsuit after COVID vaccine announcement: 'Trying to extract vengeance'New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, threatened to sue President Donald Trump's administration Friday over a gross misrepresentation of comments the president made about distribution of the forthcoming coronavirus vaccine.Speaking from the Ros…New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, threatened to sue President Donald Trump's administration Friday over a gross misrepresentation of comments the president made about distribution of the forthcoming coronavirus vaccine.

Speaking from the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump announced that up to 20 million Americans could receive the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of December.

Immediately after the announcement, Trump's detractors accused the president of threatening to withhold the vaccine from New Yorkers "to settle old scores" with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). CNN similarly claimed Trump made a "threat" to not send the vaccine to New York.

What did James say?

James accused Trump of "playing politics with people's lives."



"Any attempt by Donald Trump to deny New York access to a lifesaving #COVID19 vaccine will be met with a lawsuit, plain and simple," she said. "Stop playing politics with people's lives."

In a statement, James further attacked Trump, accusing him of "vindictive behavior" and "trying to extract vengeance on those who oppose his politics."

"If dissemination of the vaccine takes place in the twilight of a Trump Administration and the president wants to play games with people's lives, we will sue and we will win," she threatened.

Meanwhile, Cuomo accused Trump of being a "bully."

Did Trump threaten to withhold the vaccine?

Actually, no.

While announcing the rollout of the vaccine — which Trump said could be available to the general population as soon as April — Trump noted that Cuomo has questioned the legitimacy of a vaccine produced under the leadership of the Trump administration.

In fact, Trump said the vaccine will only be delivered once New York gives the government authorization to do so, which Trump said "pains me."

Trump said:

As soon as April, the vaccine will be available to the entire general population with the exception of places like New York state, where, for political reasons, the governor decided to say — and I don't think it's good politically, I think it's very bad from a health standpoint, but he wants to take his time with the vaccine. He doesn't trust where the vaccine's coming from. These are coming from the greatest companies anywhere in the world, greatest labs in the world, but he doesn't trust the fact that it's this White House, this administration, so we won't be delivering it to New York until we have authorization to do so, and that pains me to say that.

In fact, just last month, Cuomo said Americans should be "very skeptical" of the vaccine, explaining he doesn't trust the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Trump.

"What I said I'm going to do in New York is we're going to put together our own group of doctors and medical experts to review the vaccine and the efficacy and the protocol, and if they say it's safe, then I'll go to the people of New York and I will say it's safe, with that credibility. But I believe all across the country, you're going to need someone other than this FDA and this CDC saying it's safe," Cuomo said.New York AG threatens Trump with lawsuit after COVID vaccine announcement: 'Trying to extract vengeance'New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, threatened to sue President Donald Trump's administration Friday over a gross misrepresentation of comments the president made about distribution of the forthcoming coronavirus vaccine.Speaking from the Ros…New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, threatened to sue President Donald Trump's administration Friday over a gross misrepresentation of comments the president made about distribution of the forthcoming coronavirus vaccine.

In fact, Trump said the vaccine will only be delivered once New York gives the government authorization to do so, which Trump said "pains me."

Trump said:

As soon as April, the vaccine will be available to the entire general population with the exception of places like New York state, where, for political reasons, the governor decided to say — and I don't think it's good politically, I think it's very bad from a health standpoint, but he wants to take his time with the vaccine. He doesn't trust where the vaccine's coming from. These are coming from the greatest companies anywhere in the world, greatest labs in the world, but he doesn't trust the fact that it's this White House, this administration, so we won't be delivering it to New York until we have authorization to do so, and that pains me to say that.

In fact, just last month, Cuomo said Americans should be "very skeptical" of the vaccine, explaining he doesn't trust the Food and Drug Administration or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Trump.

"What I said I'm going to do in New York is we're going to put together our own group of doctors and medical experts to review the vaccine and the efficacy and the protocol, and if they say it's safe, then I'll go to the people of New York and I will say it's safe, with that credibility. But I believe all across the country, you're going to need someone other than this FDA and this CDC saying it's safe," Cuomo said.



US COVID-19 daily death toll tops 2,000 with many hospitals fullNearly 260,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, a number that could grow as the nation nears the holiday season.Nearly 260,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, a number that could grow as the nation nears the holiday season.

Daily US deaths from COVID-19 surpassed 2,000 for the first time since May and with hospitals across the country already full, portending a surge in mortalities to come as the coronavirus pandemic casts a shadow over the holiday season.

The death toll reached 2,100 on Tuesday, with another 200,000 people infected, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally, numbers that experts say could grow with millions of Americans defying official warnings and travelling for Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday.

“The US ‘each person for himself’ mindset is killing hundreds of thousands of us. Devastating to watch,” Prowell said on Twitter.

Families with university students have been forced to evaluate the risk of reuniting for Thanksgiving.

Francesca Wimer, a student at the Northwestern University in Illinois, flew home to Washington, DC, wearing an N95 mask and a face shield and checked into a hotel for 14 days, quarantining to protect her parents and grandparents.

“She was returning to a vulnerable set of people. We didn’t trust that a test was enough,” said her mother, Cynthia Wimer.

Others are just staying put.

Luke Burke, studying at the Syracuse University in upstate New York, was planning to spend Thanksgiving with his family in New Jersey until his roommate tested positive last week.

“I’m sorry I can’t be there with my parents, but it’s the right thing to do,” Burke said.

Many parents are baulking at online instruction, while others worry about sending kids back into classrooms prematurely. Teachers say they are not comfortable teaching in person.

“Every school district across the nation is in the position in which no matter what decision they make and how well thought out it is, it will leave some in the community thinking it’s the wrong decision,” said Larry Rother, senior executive director of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade educational services in Chandler, Arizona.

Help may be coming with vaccines showing promise.

Officials from the US government’s Operation Warp Speed programme told reporters on Tuesday they plan to release 6.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution after the first one is cleared by regulators for emergency use, which could happen as soon as December 10.

A Food and Drug Administration ruling on emergency use for Pfizer Inc’s vaccine is expected on December 10.

US President-elect Joe Biden has promised to make fighting the pandemic his top priority upon taking office on January 20 and will give a speech on the topic on Wednesday.

Biden will have the help of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said on C-SPAN on Wednesday he had been in contact with Biden’s staff and was willing to serve on any task force.

Outgoing President Donald Trump has remained largely silent on the subject, making a one-minute appearance in the White House briefing room on Tuesday to talk about the stock market.US COVID-19 daily death toll tops 2,000 with many hospitals fullNearly 260,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, a number that could grow as the nation nears the holiday season.Nearly 260,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, a number that could grow as the nation nears the holiday season.

Airline CEO: You’ll Need Proof Of Vaccination To FlyQantas CEO Alan Joyce says you'll need proof of vaccination against Covid-19 to be able to fly his airline internationally, whether arriving or departing Australia.

Latest: Qantas (the national airline of Australia) becomes one of the first airlines in the world to state that only passengers who have had the #COVID19 vaccine will be permitted to fly on its international flights — significant 👇🏽🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/LTWDPrlxeB — Alex Macheras (@AlexInAir) November 23, 2020

I’ve written that some countries are likely to require proof of vaccination for entry, although the speed at which vaccinations roll out to the world is likely to lag far behind the pace of the United States and Europe. That’s both an economic reality and an infrastructure reality. Much of the world will be able to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine which simply requires refrigeration, but not the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which much be stored at below freezing temperatures.

Countries without access to significant vaccine doses are more likely to require either proof of vaccination or a negative test for entry.

Qantas has been among the most aggressive airlines shutting down air travel during the pandemic. Over the summer they said they don’t expect to resume long haul operations until July 2021 although the actual timeline may be heavily contingent on restrictions for entering (and leaving) Australia, and specific estimates of service resumption predated public announcements of vaccine progress.

Pfizer announcing 95% effectiveness in trials



Moderna accountings 94.5% effectiveness in trials



AstraZeneca announcing up to 90% effectiveness, depending on the dosing regimen (I’ve written that I worry this vaccine won’t work a second time, that immunity will develop to the adenovirus used, but that same idea could also explain why using a full dose for the first shot led to the lower levels of reported efficacy)

Having multiple vaccine manufacturers, alongside Chinese vaccines, will speed up the world’s return to normal – although Joyce says not just any vaccine will do, there will have to be proof of one deemed sufficiently protective. (Given the contract Australia has with AstraZeneca I’d expect this vaccine to be on the list.)

While the head of the U.S. federal government’s vaccine efforts says 70% of the country could be vaccinated by May and return to normal, in fact some modicum of normalcy could return much earlier from a combination of people having gotten the virus and retaining some level of immunity plus vaccinations. That’s why I’ve been predicting a return to normal in summer 2021 for quite some time, at least for those in the ‘global north’.

Qantas’ requirements may not be a bellwether for the world, but they do point to an expectation that travelers will need to be vaccinated in order to have access to the world. And this requirement is likely to last, when put in place by governments, for longer than is necessary.Airline CEO: You’ll Need Proof Of Vaccination To FlyQantas CEO Alan Joyce says you'll need proof of vaccination against Covid-19 to be able to fly his airline internationally, whether arriving or departing Australia.

Simplus, an Infosys Company, Announces Vaccine Management Solution Aligned with Salesforce Work.com for VaccinesSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #covid19--Simplus, an Infosys Company, announces Infosys Vaccine Management Solution aligned with Salesforce Work.com for vaccines.SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Simplus, an Infosys company, is pleased to announce a collaboration with Salesforce for a vaccine management cloud solution built on the Salesforce Platform in support of Salesforce Work.com for Vaccines as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Combining Simplus’ resources, capabilities, and Salesforce consulting and product expertise, the companies have created an end-to-end vaccine management solution to help support the federal government’s mandate for states to be ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine.

Infosys vaccine management solution built on the Salesforce Platform covers a broad spectrum of vaccine management, including campaign management, citizen registration, prioritization, provider enrollment, supply chain visibility, forecasting, vaccine administration, wellness surveys, and adverse event monitoring. The solution is integrated with Salesforce Health Cloud that can help support compliance with applicable laws, such as HIPAA. Within this solution are two communities: one for residents and one for providers. The resident community is the one-stop-shop for individuals to find information, register with state and local governments, and schedule vaccine appointments. The provider community is the central hub for providers. Providers may, for example, apply to become a COVID-19 vaccine provider, manage appointments, maintain inventory, log vaccine administration details and document adverse effects.

Infosys vaccine management solution also utilizes other Salesforce products and solutions. Marketing Cloud leverages resident and provider data from Health Cloud to manage initial outreach, advocacy to resident populations, and follow-up communication concerning scheduling, adverse reactions and more. With MuleSoft, public health stakeholders can get a comprehensive view of their full vaccination efforts, on state and local levels, by securely and reliably integrating both their data from inside Salesforce and external data across EMR/EHRs, state-specific IISs, and CDC portals. Tableau can then be used to easily access and analyze that data through interactive visualizations to track and report population health outcomes and vaccination rates.

“ As we work toward a global solution during the pandemic, the importance of a robust vaccine management solution cannot be overstated,” said Ryan Westwood, CEO of Simplus. “ We are thrilled to bring life-changing solutions to protect our communities.”

Another benefit is the innovation team’s agile approach considering the parameters of the disease management are not yet known. Variables such as dosage frequency and vulnerable populations in geographies can be considered alongside other variables such as testing strategy and asymptomatic transmission. Vaccine management is tightly coupled with an effective containment strategy. Being able to act in concert with a widespread testing and containment strategy will be instrumental to the solution realizing its full potential.

“ Infosys’ vaccine management solution combines the power of Health Cloud, Marketing Cloud, MuleSoft and Tableau,” said Eric Paternoster, CEO of Infosys Public Services. “ We bring a holistic solution that can meet the demands of rigorous and expansive vaccine management programs. We have also architected the solution in modular fashion to complement existing systems that may already be in place. In this way, we are delivering the fastest time-to-value as well as acting in the interests of public good.”

“ We are excited about Infosys’ vaccine management solution built on the Salesforce Platform,” said Tyler Prince, EVP of Partners and Industries, Salesforce. “ Our partners are a key growth driver of the Salesforce economy, as they extend the functionality of our platform and help customers implement our technology. This solution exemplifies the impact of partner innovation combined with Salesforce products meeting an urgent community need.”

Simplus intends to integrate the vaccine management solution with testing and contact tracing to complete an overarching containment strategy for the public sector. The widespread testing strategy and preexisting public health initiatives will be instrumental to the solution realizing its full potential.

</li><li>Ramaphosa urges G20 to help Africa conf…South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa told the G20 leaders during a virtual summit on Saturday that Africa was in need of more help amid a ravaging coronavirus pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people on the continent and crushed the economy.

According to the chairperson of the African Union, with the economic activity on the continent expected to contract by 3.2 per cent in 2020, and the region falling into a recession for the first time in 25 years, the G20 should help, and help fast, and help now.

He said: “For most of this year, the G20 has focused on supporting countries in their efforts to save lives and contain the spread of the virus.

“Now, we must also confront the financial and economic aftermath.

“Many of the hardest hit economies are in Africa.

“Economic activity on the continent is expected to contract by 3.2 per cent in 2020, with the region falling into a recession for the first time in 25 years.

“The macro-economic and governance reforms undertaken by many countries were politically painful and took a time to produce results. Now all of that has been set back.

“We call on the G20 member states to use all of their persuasive powers, individually and collectively, to convince all creditor countries, the multilateral development banks, the credit rating agencies and the private sector to continue to work with us to address the problem of burgeoning and unsustainable developing country debt.

“The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative has helped to defer the immediate debt service payments of participating countries, and the recently agreed 6- month extension will provide further support.

“However, in addition to the suspension of debt service payments, large financing needs remain necessary to both stave off a deep humanitarian crisis and stimulate economic rebirth.

“The IMF should urgently consider the issuance of additional Special Drawing Rights and for the allocation of these disproportionately to member countries that need the resources most.

“Another immediate task is to ensure there is equitable and affordable access for all countries to the COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed.

“I call upon the G20 countries to assist with the funding shortfalls for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator to ensure this platform is able to deliver on its mandate.

“We have an opportunity now to drive global economic reforms.

“This includes WTO reform to address imbalances in global trade rules, measures to accelerate industrialisation in developing countries, and combatting the practice of under-invoicing, which is harming emerging market economies.

“Let us continue to work together in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation to

ensure that the global recovery is inclusive and leaves no country behind.”South African President to G20: Time to double your support for Africa amid a ravaging COVID-19 economic crisis • Today News Africa - TODAY NEWS AFRICA<ol><li>South African President to G20: Time to double your support for Africa amid a ravaging COVID-19 economic crisis • Today News Africa  TODAY NEWS AFRICA

“Economic activity on the continent is expected to contract by 3.2 per cent in 2020, with the region falling into a recession for the first time in 25 years.

“The macro-economic and governance reforms undertaken by many countries were politically painful and took a time to produce results. Now all of that has been set back.

“We call on the G20 member states to use all of their persuasive powers, individually and collectively, to convince all creditor countries, the multilateral development banks, the credit rating agencies and the private sector to continue to work with us to address the problem of burgeoning and unsustainable developing country debt.

“The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative has helped to defer the immediate debt service payments of participating countries, and the recently agreed 6- month extension will provide further support.

“However, in addition to the suspension of debt service payments, large financing needs remain necessary to both stave off a deep humanitarian crisis and stimulate economic rebirth.

“The IMF should urgently consider the issuance of additional Special Drawing Rights and for the allocation of these disproportionately to member countries that need the resources most.

“Another immediate task is to ensure there is equitable and affordable access for all countries to the COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed.

“I call upon the G20 countries to assist with the funding shortfalls for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator to ensure this platform is able to deliver on its mandate.

“We have an opportunity now to drive global economic reforms.

“This includes WTO reform to address imbalances in global trade rules, measures to accelerate industrialisation in developing countries, and combatting the practice of under-invoicing, which is harming emerging market economies.

“Let us continue to work together in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation to

ensure that the global recovery is inclusive and leaves no country behind.”



Icosavax Launches COVID-19 Vaccine Program with Preclinical Data and $16.5 Million in New FundingSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #COVID19--Icosavax today announced the launch of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine program with preclinical data and $16.5 million in new funding.SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Icosavax, Inc. today announced the launch of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine program with preclinical data on the company’s VLP vaccine candidate, IVX-411, which comprises a virus-like particle (VLP) displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array. Icosavax also announced that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has provided a $10 million grant to support the company’s COVID-19 vaccine program through the first in human Phase 1 clinical trial in young and older adults, expected to initiate in mid-2021. In addition, Icosavax received $6.5 million from Open Philanthropy to support development of the company’s vaccine platform technology and COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The company is currently advancing the necessary studies to support regulatory filings and has initiated GMP manufacturing. To enable rapid progress of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate to the clinic, Amgen has agreed to manufacture a key intermediate for initial clinical studies.

“This is truly a great example of the scientific community coming together in a time of exceptional need to fight this pandemic. We are grateful to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Open Philanthropy for their financial support and to Amgen for the supply of a key intermediate for manufacturing,” said Adam Simpson, Chief Executive Officer of Icosavax. “The team at Icosavax is dedicated to advancing vaccines against severe life-threatening respiratory diseases to protect our most at-risk populations. Because VLP vaccines have the potential to induce high-neutralizing antibody titers, our COVID-19 VLP vaccine candidate could be especially important for older adults with age-related declines in immunity.”

Developed by scientists at the University of Washington School of Medicine using structure-based vaccine design techniques invented at the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) at the UW Medicine, IVX-411, the lead vaccine candidate for COVID-19, is a self-assembling protein nanoparticle that displays 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain in a highly immunogenic array. Preclinical data from UW researchers and their collaborators show IVX-411 induces high neutralizing antibody titers in mice after a single administration and further improvement after a second administration (Cell 2020). Titers after the second administration were ten-fold higher than those seen with the soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that forms the basis of many other vaccine candidates. The data also show a strong B-cell response after immunization, critical for immune memory and a durable vaccine effect, with antibodies that target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting potential protection from escape mutations.

“These data highlight that while our VLP-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may not be first to market, it has the potential to be a best-in-class vaccine that safely delivers potent and durable immune protection,” said Icosavax co-founder Neil King, Ph.D. Dr. King is also inventor of the computationally designed VLP technology at the Institute for Protein Design, and assistant professor of biochemistry at the UW School of Medicine. “This technology is designed to drive higher neutralizing antibody titers than soluble protein approaches and to create safe, stable, and effective VLP vaccines with simple and scalable manufacturing.”

“It’s clear that we will need a variety of vaccine approaches to effectively fight this novel coronavirus,” said Jean-Paul Prieels, Ph.D., former Senior Vice President of Research and Development at GSK Vaccines and member of the scientific advisory board of Icosavax. “That’s why it’s important to advance not just the fastest but the best vaccine technologies that can deliver safe, effective, and durable protection.”

VLPs enable high-density, multivalent display of antigens in a manner that closely resembles viruses, with an important difference. VLPs contain no genetic material, so they are non-infectious and can provide a safer alternative to live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable.

Icosavax has a worldwide license with an exclusive option for IVX-411 in North America and Europe from the University of Washington.

U.S. Vaccine Allocation Planner for COVID-19 Launched by Ariadne Labs and Surgo FoundationWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #COVID19--The Vaccine Allocation Planner for COVID-19 helps state and county decisionmakers estimate high-priority populations in every county of the U.S.WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--When COVID-19 vaccines become available in the United States, there won’t be enough to vaccinate everyone right away, and states will need to allocate them to their highest priority populations. A new tool provides state and county decisionmakers the region-specific data they will need to distribute vaccines to different populations based on available vaccine doses, priority populations, and vulnerable communities.

The Vaccine Allocation Planner for COVID-19 was jointly developed by Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; and Surgo Foundation, a nonprofit focused on solving health and social problems with precision.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recently launched a set of vaccine allocation guidelines for the United States, identifying 13 high-priority populations to be vaccinated in phases:

Phase 1A includes high-risk workers in health facilities and first responders.

and Phase 1B includes people with significant comorbid conditions and people living in congregate care settings.

and Phase 2 includes critical workers in other high-risk settings (public transit, grocery stores, etc.); teachers and school staff; people with moderate comorbid conditions; all older adults; people in homeless shelters or group homes; and incarcerated people or staff who work in jails.

and Phase 3 includes young adults; children ; and the remaining critical workers.

; and the Phase 4 includes anyone residing in the United States who didn’t have access to vaccines in prior phases.

The Vaccine Allocation Planner for COVID-19 helps state and county decisionmakers operationalize the NASEM guidelines, allowing users to obtain size estimates of the high-priority populations in their immediate regions and weight purely by this criteria, while also considering other factors like community vulnerability. It also helps users estimate the number of vaccine doses available; and the percentage of vaccine coverage achievable under various scenarios.

“State and local leaders are going to need to make decisions about how to distribute their allotted COVID-19 vaccine doses, and there are many permutations those decisions could take,” said Dr. Sema Sgaier, Executive Director of Surgo Foundation and adjunct assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Our tool gives them the concrete, localized data they will need to estimate with precision and maximize the public health impact of the coronavirus vaccine, while at the same time prioritizing vulnerable populations.”

"In the midst of the pandemic, we will face a scarce supply of the COVID-19 vaccines. Nations, states and local municipalities are planning for effective vaccine distribution,” said Dr. Rebecca Weintraub, Director of Vaccine Delivery at Ariadne Labs and Associate Physician, Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. "Unfortunately, too often scarce resources go to the most privileged. We built this tool for leaders with the data they will need on available vaccine doses, priority populations, and at risk communities to plan for effective and equitable vaccine distribution.“

“Our committee laid out a four-phased, evidence based approach to COVID-19 vaccine allocation in the United States, but there will be a number of uncertainties around that allocation that state and local leaders must plan for,” said NASEM Committee Co-chair Dr. Helene Gayle, President and CEO of the Chicago Community Trust. “This tool helps them do that, providing the most reliable estimates of high-priority populations and allowing them to weigh that data against potential scenarios.”

Data for the Vaccine Allocation Planner for COVID-19 were sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), California Office of Emergency Services, CDC’s National Health Safety Network (NHSN), Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD), Clark et al., 2020, and the Vera Institute of Justice.

However, this doesn’t mean you can’t secure a great deal more by looking outside of the traditionally popular locations of London, Monaco and the rest. In fact, you could secure a whole castle for a similar price tag in countries all over the world and whether you’re looking for a Halloween appropriate home or a COVID-safe bolthole, you will get a lot more space for your money.

Mike Pence Lies About Pfizer Vaccine, Claims Credit For The Trump AdministrationAs soon as this bald-faced lie came out on Twitter, Pfizer officials were asked what Pence was talking about, as they hadn't taken any government money to work on a vaccine. Pfizer, rightly, refused to work with the Trump administration.

Vice President Mike Pence, the Coronavirus Task Force chief, and former Trump UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are under fire for trying to give credit for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to President Donald Trump and the White House's "Operation War Speed." Pfizer announced Monday morning its coronavirus vaccine is 90% effective. The pharmaceutical giant refused to partner with the Trump administration to develop the drug, instead it worked with a German group.

HUGE NEWS: Thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President @realDonaldTrump, @pfizer announced its Coronavirus Vaccine trial is EFFECTIVE, preventing infection in 90% of its volunteers. — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) November 9, 2020

Pfizer's Dr. Jansen sought to distance the company from Operation Warp Speed and presidential politics, noting that the company did not take any federal money to help pay for research and development.



“We were never part of the Warp Speed,” she said. https://t.co/baknu0iOtd — Virginia Hughes (@virginiahughes) November 9, 2020

It's not just that lie so brazenly, but that they're so stupid about it.

Immediate jeers all around for this bunch of know-nothings.

And, as Pence claims credit, Trump administration is refusing to sign off on transition which a source says could also slow down the development & distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.



So not only did Pfizer not join Trump's Operation Warp Speed, they could be slowed by Trump. https://t.co/JMisMU20iT — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) November 9, 2020

COVAXX Announces $2.8 Billion in Advance Purchase Commitments to Deliver More Than 140 Million Vaccine Doses to Emerging CountriesHAUPPAUGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #COVID19--US biotech company COVAXX announces $2.8 billion in advance purchase commitments for 140 million doses of its peptide-based vaccine to fight COVID-19.HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--COVAXX, a U.S. company developing a multitope peptide-based vaccine to fight COVID-19, announces advanced purchase commitments of more than 140 million doses of its UB-612 vaccine, totaling over $2.8 billion, to deliver vaccines in multiple countries, including Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. These public and private commitments follow the start of human trials in Taiwan and the September agreement with Diagnosticos da America SA (Dasa S.A.), the largest clinical diagnostic company in Brazil, to conduct Phase 2/3 clinical trials and distribute vaccines within Brazil.

“In parallel with the expedited clinical development of UB-612, we are working to help countries with the greatest unmet needs customize their plans for vaccine studies, supply and distribution,” said Mei Mei Hu, co-founder and CEO of COVAXX. “The realistic view of vaccine production is that we will need a wide range of vaccine options utilizing different technologies to meet worldwide demand. As much as vaccines matter, vaccinations matter more. To be administered effectively, vaccines need to demonstrate easy and affordable distribution, durability of response with the capability to further extend it with effective boosts, as well as the ability to adapt to a potential mutation in the virus while building on the first vaccines made available.”

COVAXX (not to be confused with single “x” COVAX) is currently completing Phase 1 clinical trials of UB-612 in Taiwan and has an agreement with the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), home of the National Pandemic Center, to also conduct trials in the U.S. Last month, COVAXX announced a global logistics partnership with Maersk, the world’s largest shipping and integrated logistics provider, that creates a framework for all transportation and supply chain services that will be needed to deliver COVAXX’s UB-612 around the world.

“We applaud the progress of other vaccine developers, but recognize the global requirement for billions of doses,” said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis, COVAXX’s co-founder and vice-chairman. “Our vaccine has the following key attributes that make it potentially best in class: First, it is boostable. COVID-19 is not ‘one and done’ and populations will likely require boosters to protect against the virus. UB-612 technology has been shown to effectively boost repeatedly and without any side effects. Second, the vaccine is stable at 2-8C and can be delivered via existing distribution infrastructure and normal refrigeration; Third, from preliminary data, UB-612 has observed minimal reactogenicity (i.e. no fevers, chills or systemic issues). While clinical efficacy data will be available during the next few months, we believe COVAXX is a best-in-class vaccine that is affordable and accessible for all earthlings.”

“The reality of vaccine manufacturing is that some vaccines will be available earlier than others, though in limited quantities and most likely available in the countries in which they are manufactured, as well as countries with a robust infrastructure and the financial ability to handle the complex cold-chain distribution,” said Lou Reese, COVAXX’s co-founder and executive chairman. “COVAXX is specifically focused on disrupting this traditional method. Our vaccine will be distributed globally, and our primary focus is on supplying emerging markets.”

About COVAXX. The mission of COVAXX is to democratize health and safeguard lives worldwide by tackling the global COVID-19 pandemic using cost-effective, scalable and proven science-based solutions. Produced from a commercially proven, vaccine platform, UB-612 is a multitope vaccine designed to activate both B and T-cell arms of the immune system. Preclinical studies have shown that the UB-612 vaccine candidate generated high titers of neutralizing antibodies.

COVAXX is a subsidiary of United Biomedical Inc (UBI), founded in 1985, with headquarters in New York. The company is a scientific trailblazer creating technological firsts, including the manufacture and commercialization of more than 100 million antibody blood diagnostic tests and 5 billion vaccine doses against infectious diseases in animal health. With proprietary access to UBI's core technology platforms, COVAXX can develop and commercialize high precision antibody tests and a promising COVID-19 vaccine that together would form a unique Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Individuals (DIVI) system.

Indian COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories was hit with a cyber attack that forced it to shut down its plants in Brazil, India, Russia, the U.K., and the U.S..

According to The Economic Times the company suffered a data breach.

The Indian company is the contractor for Russia’s “Sputinik V” COVID-19 vaccine, recently the Drug Control General of India (DCGI) gave it the authorization to enter Phase 2 human trials.

According to the BBC, the phone lines at the company’s UK sites in Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire were down.

In response to the security breach, the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer has isolated all data center services.

“In the wake of a detected cyber-attack, we have isolated all data center services to take required preventive actions,” CIO Mukesh Rathi said in a media statement. “We are anticipating all services to be up within 24 hours, and we do not foresee any major impact on our operations due to this incident.”

According to the media, the attack is likely the result of a cyber espionage operation aimed at stealing info on the COVID-19 vaccine development.

At the time it is not clear whether the attack was carried out by a nation-state actor or a cyber crime gang.

In July, the British National Cyber Security Centre revealed that Russia-linked group APT29 is conducting cyberespionage campaigns targeting UK, US, and Canadian organizations working of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

In the same period, the US Justice Department accused two Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets from companies worldwide and recently involved in attacks against firms developing a vaccine for the COVID-19.

In September, the El Pais newspaper reported that Chinese hackers have stolen information from Spanish laboratories working on a vaccine for COVID19.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Earlier on Monday, AstraZeneca made an announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine's clinical trials in Brazil and the United Kingdom had shown higher effectiveness in combating the infection.

"One dosing regimen showed vaccine efficacy of 90 percent when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen showed 62 percent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent," The pharmaceutical firm said.

Sharing the good news, Poonawalla expressed his happiness. Poonawalla's SII has a production and distribution alliance with AstraZeneca and Oxford University for their COVID-vaccine candidate.

"I am delighted to hear that, Covishield, a low-cost, logistically manageable & soon to be widely available, #COVID19 vaccine, will offer protection up to 90 percent in one type of dosage regime and 62 percent in the other dosage regime. Further details on this will be provided this evening," Poonawalla wrote on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Niti Aayog member VK Paul on November 23 expected emergency authorisation for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to be sought in the UK. Following this, if approved, the Indian government may provide emergency use authorisation to Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the country.

Currently, Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is undergoing final-stage Phase 3 clinical trials in India. As per expectations, the Phase 3 clinical trials of SII vaccine should be over by January/February 2021, following which market authorisation can be sought.

SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine and has received manufacturing and stockpiling licence from the Drugs Controller General of India. Poonawalla claims to produce 30-40 crore doses of the Oxford vaccine for use by the first quarter of 2021.

In India, four-five vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials. They are Serum Institute of India (Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine), Bharat Biotech-IMCR (COVAXIN), Dr Reddy's Laboratories (Sputnik-V) and Cadila Healthcare’s ZyCovD.COVID-19 vaccine | Anand Mahindra lauds SII#39;s Adar Poonawalla, says #39;Covishield#39; possibly the best bet for IndiaAstraZeneca announced that its COVID-19 vaccine#39;s clinical trials in Brazil and the United Kingdom had shown higher effectiveness in combating the infection.Mahindra and Mahindra group chairman Anand Mahindra on November 23 lauded Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO and owner Adar Poonawalla, stating that SII-AstraZeneca's 'Covishield' vaccine could be one of the best bets for India in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mahindra in his tweet also hailed Poonawalla for making the COVID-19 vaccine economical and effective. He opined that easier storage and transportability of this vaccine makes it possibly the best bet for India.

'Great day for science and humanity': Pfizer says Covid-19 vaccine more than 90% effective in final trialsA vaccine being developed by Pfizer has been found to be more than 90 percent effective against Covid-19, the pharmaceutical company said. Read Full Article at RT.comA vaccine being developed by Pfizer has been found to be more than 90 percent effective against Covid-19, the pharmaceutical company said.

The finding was the result of the first independent analysis of any Covid-19 vaccine in phase 3 trials, the final stage before commercial licensing.

The study found that 94 participants who received the two-dose vaccine were protected against the disease 28 days after their first inoculation.

The American firm developed the jab along with Germany’s BioNTech. The efficacy rate is significantly above the 50 percent effectiveness required by the US Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine.

UPDATE: We are proud to announce, along with @BioNTech_Group, that our mRNA-based #vaccine candidate has, at an interim analysis, demonstrated initial evidence of efficacy against #COVID19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. — Pfizer Inc. (@pfizer) November 9, 2020

“Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19,” said Dr Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO.

“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen,” Dr Bourla added.

The company said it will share additional efficacy and safety data in the coming weeks. It said it expects to produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine next year.

In the United States, Pfizer expects to seek broad emergency use authorization of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85. To secure this it will need to have collected two months of safety data on around half of the study's roughly 44,000 participants.

The company did not share precise detail on how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine.

Pfizer and BioNTech have a $1.95 billion contract with the US government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. The companies have also reached supply agreements with the European Union, the UK, Canada and Japan.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that there is no time for complacency in confronting the coronavirus despite positive news about possible vaccines.

“Right now we are extremely concerned by the surge in #COVID19 cases we’re seeing in some countries,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a Tweet on Monday.

“Particularly in Europe and the Americas, #healthworkers and health systems are being pushed to the breaking point.”

More than 54.44 million people have been reported infected by the coronavirus globally and 1,318,042 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.WHO says no time for COVID complacency despite vaccine news - ReutersThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that there is no time for complacency in confronting the coronavirus despite positive news about possible vaccines.FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured on the headquarters of the World Health Orgnaization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, June 25, 2020.

The First Interim Data Analysis of the Sputnik V Vaccine Against COVID-19 Phase III Clinical Trials in the Russian Federation Demonstrated 92% EfficacyMOSCOW--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #COVID19--The National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (Gamaleya Center) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign…MOSCOW--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (Gamaleya Center) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund), announce that the Sputnik V vaccine, the world's first registered vaccine against coronavirus (registered on the 11th of August under the emergency use authorization mechanism) created on the well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors, demonstrated high efficacy. The confirmation is based on the first interim data from the largest double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials in Russia involving 40,000 volunteers.

The trials evaluated efficacy among over 16,000 volunteers who received the vaccine or placebo 21 days after the first injection. As a result of a statistical analysis of 20 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicates that the Sputnik V vaccine had an efficacy rate of 92% after the second dose.

Separately, in September the vaccine was first administered to a group of volunteers from the “red zones” of Russian hospitals. The observation of additional 10,000 vaccinated volunteers representing medics and other high-risk groups under the civil use of the vaccine out of clinical trials also confirmed the vaccine’s efficacy rate of over 90 percent.

The data received will be published by Gamaleya Center researchers in one of the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical academic journals following an independent valuation of the data by leading epidemiology experts. Following the completion of Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine, Gamaleya Center will provide access to the full clinical trial report.

As of November 11, as part of the clinical trials in Russia’s 29 medical centers, more than 20,000 volunteers were vaccinated with first dose and over 16,000 volunteers with the first and the second dose of the vaccine.

In addition, as of November 11, no unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research. Some of those vaccinated had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection site, flu-like syndrome including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.

During the clinical trials, the safety of the vaccine is constantly being monitored; information is analysed by the Independent Monitoring Committee comprising of leading Russian scientists. Collection, quality control and data processing is conducted in line with ICH GCP standards and involving active participation of Moscow’s Health Department and Crocus Medical, the contract research organization (CRO).

Observation of study participants will continue for six months after which the final report will be presented. Currently Sputnik V Phase III clinical trials are approved and are undergoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, as well as Phase II-III in India. A separate detailed study of the vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity for elderly people is being conducted.

The research data will be provided by RDIF to the national regulators of countries interested in purchasing the Russian vaccine in order to streamline the registration process.

Mikhail Murashko, Minister of Health of the Russian Federation:

“The use of the vaccine and the results of clinical trials demonstrate that it is an efficient solution to stop the spread of coronavirus infection, а preventive healthcare tool, and this is the most successful path to defeat the pandemic.”

Alexander Gintsburg, Gamaleya Center Director:

“The publication of the interim results of the post-registration clinical trials that convincingly demonstrate Sputnik V vaccine’s efficacy gives way to mass vaccination in Russia against COVID-19 in the coming weeks. Thanks to the production scale up at new manufacturing sites, Sputnik V vaccine will soon be available for a wider population. This will break the current trend and lead to an eventual decrease in COVID-19 infection rates, first in Russia, then globally.”

Denis Logunov, Gamaleya Center Deputy Director:

“Positive interim results of Phase III give reasons to expect a successful outcome of Sputnik V clinical trials. We will continue to process and analyse all the data and look to the future with optimism, expecting that results of our work will help end the pandemic sooner.”

Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, Russian Direct Investment Fund:

“Sputnik V is the first registered vaccine against COVID-19 in the world, the vaccine is based on safe and effective platform of human adenoviral vectors. More and more countries are recognizing the human adenoviral vector platform and plan to include these vaccines, as the most studied and known, in their respective national vaccine portfolio. I would also like to stress the importance of international cooperation and close partnership among vaccine-developing states. Vaccines should be above politics. The world needs a diversified portfolio of high-quality vaccines with Sputnik V, based on the well-tested human adenoviral vector platform, being an important element of it.”

The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses was confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades (while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953). Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body's stable immune response.

On September 4, The Lancet, one of world’s leading medical journals, published a research paper on the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine that showed no serious adverse events and an effective immune response of those vaccinated.

Requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine came from over 50 countries. The vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by RDIF’s international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries. The existing RDIF contracts with international partners enable the production of 500 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine outside Russia annually. RDIF is now considering additional requests from a number of countries and companies to further increase its foreign production capacities.

On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Center was registered by Russia’s Health Ministry and became the world’s first registered vaccine against COVID-19. Detailed information on the Sputnik V vaccine, its human adenoviral vectors technological platform, and other details are available at sputnikvaccine.com.

EXCLUSIVE | Wait for COVID-19 vaccine to end soon: Health Minister Harsh Vardhan's BIG announcement - India TV News<ol><li>EXCLUSIVE | Wait for COVID-19 vaccine to end soon: Health Minister Harsh Vardhan's BIG announcement  India TV News
</li><li>Confident that Covid-19 vaccine will be ready in 3-4 months, says Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan  Deccan Herald
</li>…After a brief slowdown, the number of coronavirus cases is once again skyrocketing with the national capital Delhi witnessing a precarious scenario. Hazardous air pollution together with lowering of guard by people during the festive season resulted in COVID-19 cases spiral in the city.

Amid the concerns, all eyes are now on the COVID-19 vaccine. When will the vaccine be available in India? Citizens are awaiting a positive and early response to the question. Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, in an exclusive interview with India TV, has made a big announcement.

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that by June 2021, the government would vaccinate approximately 25-30 crore people. "Details regarding cold chain requirements and logistics have already been put in place. We are expecting to get the good news concerning the vaccine by February-March," the minister said.

He said that over 200 vaccine candidates are under development across the world of which 30 are Indian. " Out of these, 5 are in advance stage of which 2 are in the third stage of clinical trial. I hope that a vaccine will be available by early 2021," Harsh Vardhan said.

Harsh Vardhan on Delhi COVID-19 scare

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the rising number of coronavirus cases in Delhi is certainly worrisome, and asserted that the government is doing all to flatten the graph. "Delhi is the national capital and the situation here is certainly a cause of worry for us. It sends out a negative message if the situation deteriorates in the capital," he said.

The minister stressed that it was important for people not to lower their guard in the fight against the deadly disease. Harsh Vardhan said, "It appears that after 10-11 months people are now thinking that they can handle the disease. A few may also have started believing that corona won't affect them. This is unfortunate."

Various vaccine candidates

The phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started.

</li><li>Confident that Covid-19 vaccine will be ready in 3-4 months, says Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan  Deccan Herald
</li>…After a brief slowdown, the number of coronavirus cases is once again skyrocketing with the national capital Delhi witnessing a precarious scenario. Hazardous air pollution together with lowering of guard by people during the festive season resulted in COVID-19 cases spiral in the city.

Amid the concerns, all eyes are now on the COVID-19 vaccine. When will the vaccine be available in India? Citizens are awaiting a positive and early response to the question. Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, in an exclusive interview with India TV, has made a big announcement.

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that by June 2021, the government would vaccinate approximately 25-30 crore people. "Details regarding cold chain requirements and logistics have already been put in place. We are expecting to get the good news concerning the vaccine by February-March," the minister said.

He said that over 200 vaccine candidates are under development across the world of which 30 are Indian. " Out of these, 5 are in advance stage of which 2 are in the third stage of clinical trial. I hope that a vaccine will be available by early 2021," Harsh Vardhan said.

Harsh Vardhan on Delhi COVID-19 scare

Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the rising number of coronavirus cases in Delhi is certainly worrisome, and asserted that the government is doing all to flatten the graph. "Delhi is the national capital and the situation here is certainly a cause of worry for us. It sends out a negative message if the situation deteriorates in the capital," he said.

The minister stressed that it was important for people not to lower their guard in the fight against the deadly disease. Harsh Vardhan said, "It appears that after 10-11 months people are now thinking that they can handle the disease. A few may also have started believing that corona won't affect them. This is unfortunate."

Various vaccine candidates

The phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started.

Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have said their vaccine candidate was found to be more than 95 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories will also soon start the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India.

REPORT: Pfizer Vaccine Could Be Sent Out Mid-DecemberThe first doses of Pfizer&#039;s coronavirus vaccine will reportedly begin being dispersed by mid-December if the vaccine receives FDA authorization.The first doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine will reportedly begin being dispersed by mid-December if the vaccine receives Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization.

Operation Warp Speed officials told reporters Tuesday that the Health and Human Services Agency is working on recommendations for prioritization, according to The Hill. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said health care workers, nursing home patients and those who are vulnerable should receive the vaccine first, The Hill reports.

State officials were informed Friday of how many doses they would receive in the first distribution of vaccines, with states allowed to make their own decisions as to who will be the first to receive the vaccine, according to The Hill. Gen. Gustave Perna said the vaccine would be allocated to states based on their overall population, according to The Washington Post.

“[Governors] will decide whom the vaccine is given to,” Azar said, according to The Hill. “We hope that our recommendations will carry weight with them but at the end of the day they will make that decision.” (RELATED: ‘You Do The Math’: Vince Coglianese Targets Pfizer’s Timing On COVID-19 Vaccine Announcement)

More than 40 million doses of the vaccine is anticipated to be ready by the end of 2020, with Azar saying he expects the vaccine should be ready for the general public by next year, according to the report.

Pfizer announced in early November that their vaccine was over 90% effective with no serious safety concerns aside from side effects which included fatigue, chills and fever.

Pfizer submitted an emergency use authorization to the FDA Nov. 20, the company announced.



Pfizer CEO says vaccine is ready to be shipped 'overnight' across US once FDA authorizesThe chief executive of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind the development of a vaccine with 95% effectiveness against COVID-19, said this week that his company is ready to ship the vaccine "overnight" to most places in the United States once it receive…The chief executive of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind the development of a vaccine with 95% effectiveness against COVID-19, said this week that his company is ready to ship the vaccine "overnight" to most places in the United States once it receives emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Pfizer, who produced the vaccine in conjunction with German company BioNTech, is expected to submit a request for that authorization "within days," according to a Wednesday press release about the conclusion of its Phase 3 human trials.

During an interview with the New York Times DealBook Online Summit the day before, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla explained that his company is prepared "to ship to most of the places [in the U.S.] overnight" — which is quite a feat considering the vaccine requires storage in vials at a temperature between -94 and -112 degrees Fahrenheit.

In order to distribute the vaccine safely and effectively, Pfizer produced special packaging containers to move the product while maintaining the required low temperature.

"Those boxes are isothermic boxes that have a GPS and also a temperature meter so we know at any point where the box is and what is the temperature so if something goes wrong, which we don't anticipate, we will not use the vaccine," explained Bourla in the interview. "Every box is a small box like that and can take 1,000 to 5,000 doses. And when we ship it, we don't need to use refrigeration. So we can ship it in cars, trucks, planes, boats, whatever. In the US, we will ship to most of the places overnight."

"So once we receive an address from the government, the next day the product will be there," he continued. "And once people receive it they can keep it for weeks in the box or they can keep it for months in their freezers or they can put it in refrigeration and keep it for a week, approximately. I think that the demand will be so big, it's going to be injected in hours rather than days or weeks. So we feel very confident about it."

On Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that a final assessment of trial data on their vaccine showed it was 95% effective against the disease and that it had cleared the safety milestone required by the FDA for emergency use. The two companies added that the vaccine's efficacy was consistent "across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics."



"Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021," they said in the statement.

A second vaccine, developed by Moderna, has also reported stunningly high success against COVID-19 in its human trials this week and also plans to apply for emergency use authorization in short order.

Barring any hiccups in the process, this means an effective vaccine could be available to millions of Americans by the end of the year.Pfizer CEO says vaccine is ready to be shipped 'overnight' across US once FDA authorizesThe chief executive of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind the development of a vaccine with 95% effectiveness against COVID-19, said this week that his company is ready to ship the vaccine "overnight" to most places in the United States once it receive…The chief executive of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind the development of a vaccine with 95% effectiveness against COVID-19, said this week that his company is ready to ship the vaccine "overnight" to most places in the United States once it receives emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

</li><li>Could the Novel Coronavirus Evolve …The COVID‐19 pandemic spread worldwide with over 38 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths as of October 15, 2020. The clinical manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection range from asymptomatic to life‐threatening pneumonia, with the main symptoms being respiratory and gastrointestinal in nature. However, several patients report neurological symptoms including smell and taste impairments, such as anosmia, cacosmia, ageusia and dysgeusia.1 Although the spread of the disease has been favoured by its contagious features, the role of many asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients, who can be very efficient vectors for the virus, should not be underestimated. The identification of these patients is essential to implement the isolation and tracking strategies that have proven to be our best weapon against the virus.2 For this reason, early detection and characterization of each symptom will be a critical element in our final success against the virus. In the present commentary, we provide a brief description of the characteristics of gustatory and olfactory alterations in COVID‐19 patients and discuss the diagnostic implications of drug‐related gustatory and olfactory alterations on the detection of these chemosensory symptoms.

Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions affect at least about 41% and 38%, respectively, of patients diagnosed with COVID‐19, with no significant gender differences. However, the prevalence is likely influenced by self‐diagnosis and under‐reporting.3 Both taste and smell alterations have been described as persistent, with a duration ranging between one to several weeks. Olfactory and/or gustatory impairments in COVID‐19 patients can be the first isolated symptoms, or present either before or after additional multiple signs. The diagnostic utility attributed to smell and taste dysfunctions (mainly anosmia) [low sensitivity (23–43%) and high specificity (93–99%)] for the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the initial onset of these symptoms may be key points for an early diagnosis. Olfactory and gustatory impairments are associated with a mild course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and occur more frequently in young adults,3 making these symptoms an important diagnostic element in a population that may be less inclined to be tested, thus contributing to the virus spread.3

The pathophysiology of these chemosensory symptoms could involve different biological targets and pathways. Olfactory and gustatory disorders are often associated with upper respiratory tract infections, but available evidence shows that smell and taste dysfunctions also occur without concomitant nasal obstruction or congestion in patients with COVID‐19. Olfactory dysfunctions in COVID‐19 patients are attributed to different disorders (including post‐viral anosmia syndrome, cleft syndrome or impairment of brain olfactory sense centre) with a direct involvement of SARS‐CoV‐2.4 The virus is thought to have neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties, which are common features reported previously for SARS‐CoV.4 However, although post‐viral olfactory loss is well documented, its pathophysiology remains not fully disclosed, even though it likely involves both central or peripheral olfactory processing pathways.4 SARS‐CoV‐2 is supposed to cause olfactory dysfunction of neural and non‐neuronal cells through both a direct or indirect mechanism leading to a transient or persistent olfactory impairment.5 Entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 into human cells results from their fusion caused by binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease and by spike cleavage mediated by cellular proteases, such as furin: cells expressing these proteins are virus targets.6, 7 In the respiratory area of mammalian nasal cavity, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed on ciliated and goblet cells, making them targets for SARS‐Cov‐2 and confirming the nose as a viable route for virus infection. Of note, evidence showed that nonneuronal cells of olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, including sustentacular cells and pericytes, express both ACE2 and other associated entry proteins6 (Figure 1). These cells are essential for preservation of integrity and functionality of olfactory sensory neurons, and their damage can lead to smell dysfunction up to causing anosmia.6

FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Major drug interferences for smell and taste dysfunctions in the setting of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, according to potential ACE2‐dependent mechanism, drug neurotropism and drug distribution in nasal and oral areas

Gustatory sensation can be disturbed in the setting of primary olfactory disorders. However, ageusia or dysgeusia have been reported also as isolated clinical manifestations. ACE2 has been found to be expressed in the mucosa of the oral cavity, in salivary glands (Figure 1), and it is highly represented in the epithelial cells of tongue, including taste buds, thus providing another entry route to SARS‐CoV‐2.8 This mechanism also supports the observation that oral symptoms occur in the early phases of COVID‐19 infection. In addition, salivary antimicrobial agents help protect the mucosa, chemosensory receptor cells and taste bud functions. Thus, an impairment of the salivary flow or an imbalance in the chemical composition of saliva can affect the maintenance of taste buds, and consequently taste. Considering that SARS‐CoV‐2 can target tongue, salivary glands and cells of the oral mucosa through its binding of ACE2, the virus could directly damage several structures involved in the gustatory function. However, a neurogenic source of the taste impairment cannot be ruled out.

Several commonly used drugs have been reported to affect chemosensory perceptions and their effects could have diagnostic implications in COVID‐19 patients. Among the possible causes of chemosensory impairments, drugs are responsible for up to 13% of cases.9 Drug‐induced taste and smell dysfunctions can be explained by direct (e.g. alteration of both neurotransmitter function and neural interactions in sensory coding brain areas) or indirect (e.g. modifying chemical environment of sensing receptor and causing physical hindrance to chemical molecules accessing the receptors) mechanisms.10 Local anaesthetics, several antimicrobials and antineoplastic drugs have been reported to affect smell and taste; detailed data on the putative impact of most of these drugs on olfaction is limited,11 with exception for fluoroquinolones, which were recently investigated by the European Medicines Agency for potential permanent smell and taste disorders.11 Gustatory dysfunctions are known to be caused also by the antifungal terbinafine, statins and some antihypertensive drugs.9, 10 Among antimicrobials, the macrolide azithromycin is being used for treating patients with COVID‐19. This drug is known to induce chemosensory adverse dru reactions (ADRs) such as ageusia, dysgeusia, anosmia and parosmia, and is characterized by bitter taste.11 The systemic intake of these drugs allows them to reach nasal and salivary secretions, thus suggesting a direct stimulation of taste and smell receptors.9 Despite the unclear underlying mechanism, we cannot exclude that azithromycin, as well as other macrolides, could aggravate gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions in COVID‐19 patients. Moreover, people aware of chemosensory ADRs to drugs could misclassify the perceived dysfunctions by attributing them to medicines instead of SARS‐CoV‐2.

Considering the plausible involvement of ACE2 in taste and smell disorders in COVID‐19 patients, the possible effect of drugs affecting the expression and activity of this enzyme on chemosensory perception and the consequences for COVID‐19 diagnosis deserve further discussion. Taste disorders, like metallic or sweet taste, and ageusia are reported also for ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which are widely used for hypertension, one of the prevalent COVID‐19 comorbidities together with diabetes.10, 12 Initially, gustatory dysfunctions were mainly attributed to the sulfhydryl group of some ACEI, such as captopril. However, non‐sulfhydryl molecules (e.g. enalapril) can produce the same taste alterations, thus suggesting that other mechanisms are implicated in the disturbance of the gustatory sense pathway. ACEI and ARB are thought to induce upregulation of the ACE2,13 which is expressed in both olfactory and nasal cavities, tongue and oral mucosa. The potential increase in the expression of ACE2 at this level could explain a possible mechanism for severe taste and smell disorders associated with ACEI and ARB. If the ACE2‐dependent mechanism were to be confirmed as the explanation for chemosensory disorders in COVID‐19 patients, it is conceivable that these drugs could modulate the clinical manifestations of taste and smell impairments associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This could be true also for the thiazolidinedione antidiabetics, which have been reported to increase ACE2 expression.13 Notably, antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs could either exacerbate or mitigate the manifestation of olfactory and gustatory impairments likely caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, with possible consequences for the diagnosis. Smell and taste impairments may develop with various degrees of intensity among COVID‐19 patients and were found to be early symptoms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Therefore, medications that interfere with these symptoms, especially mild symptoms, could cause these COVID‐19‐specific clinical signs to be missed, likely delaying the diagnosis. Indeed, olfactory and gustatory disorders could present as prodromal or as the only manifestation of COVID‐19.

In summary, we believe that any element useful for early identification of COVID‐19 infection should be used to limit the infection as much as possible. In the case of the pandemic overlapping with the seasonal flu epidemic, alteration of taste and smell are specific symptoms of COVID‐19 that can be exploited to identify COVID‐19 patients and prevent the spread of the infection. However, many drugs could simulate these sensory alterations and must always be considered in the differential diagnosis, to avoid them being an obstacle to the identification of COVID‐19 patients. Since many of the drugs most frequently associated with taste and smell changes, such as ACE inhibitors and antibiotics, are very likely to be taken by patients with COVID‐19 and other respiratory infections, the hypothesis of this interference may not be that remote and it should be considered with utmost care.Olfactory and gustatory impairments in COVID‐19 patients: Role in early diagnosis and interferences by concomitant drugs - Ferraro - - British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Wiley Online Library - Wiley<ol><li>Olfactory and gustatory impairments in COVID‐19 patients: Role in early diagnosis and interferences by concomitant drugs - Ferraro - - British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Wiley Online Library  Wiley

More Safety Data Would Be Nice, But We Need a Vaccine Now Wired

Horseshoe crabs are crucial to creating vaccines, but they are facing extinction The Hill

A systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (PDF) Nature. From the Conclusion: “Herein, we reviewed current vaccine strategies of several pathogenic viruses with the aim to improve vaccine efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2. Antigen design plays a significant role in maximizing the immunogenicity. It is necessary to include the important epitopes while excluding the unimportant ones. Moreover, the structure design of the immunogen requires additional research. Employing a suitable delivery system is also critical for vaccine efficacy. Determining which method works best depends on many factors, including the types of vaccines and vaccination routes. Furthermore, adjuvants should be added to the various types of vaccines to enhance immunogenicity; therefore, the selection of appropriate adjuvants is crucial for developing SARSCoV-2 vaccines. Until now, only several studies had reported the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. Further trials must test the safety and efficacy of vaccines and search for effective approaches to optimize the vaccines.

More Safety Data Would Be Nice, But We Need a Vaccine Now Wired

A systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (PDF) Nature. From the Conclusion: “Herein, we reviewed current vaccine strategies of several pathogenic viruses with the aim to improve vaccine efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2. Antigen design plays a significant role in maximizing the immunogenicity. It is necessary to include the important epitopes while excluding the unimportant ones. Moreover, the structure design of the immunogen requires additional research. Employing a suitable delivery system is also critical for vaccine efficacy. Determining which method works best depends on many factors, including the types of vaccines and vaccination routes. Furthermore, adjuvants should be added to the various types of vaccines to enhance immunogenicity; therefore, the selection of appropriate adjuvants is crucial for developing SARSCoV-2 vaccines. Until now, only several studies had reported the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. Further trials must test the safety and efficacy of vaccines and search for effective approaches to optimize the vaccines. In conclusion, we hope the insights provided above will aid in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.” Must-read for analysts; exhaustive, informative, reasonably clear language, neutral in tone.

A Covid-19 vaccine may be rolled out by March 2021 to the most vulnerable, which along with other advances could fundamentally change the course of the pandemic, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday.

Bruce Aylward also told the WHO’s annual ministerial assembly that interim results announced from Pfizer Inc’s late-stage vaccine trials were “very positive”.

“There is still much work to be done, this is just interim results...but some very positive results coming today which should hold great promise hopefully for the entire world as we move forward,” Aylward told the 194-member state forum.

Pfizer said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine with partner BioNTech was more than 90% effective.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted shortly afterwards: “We welcome the encouraging vaccine news from @pfizer & @BioNTech_Group & salute all scientists & partners around the who are developing new safe, efficacious tools to beat #Covid19.’

Aylward, referring to all three pillars of the ACT (Access to Covid Tools) Accelerator launched in April, said: “In diagnostics we are in a position to massively expand testing globally, in therapeutics we have sufficient tools right now to substantially reduce the risk of dying from this disease and in the area of vaccines - with the news of today especially - we are on the verge of having the readiness in place to roll out doses for high-risk populations in the late first quarter, early 2nd quarter.”

However, he warned that an “acute funding gap” of $4.5 billion could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.Covid-19 vaccine could fundamentally change pandemic direction: WHO - Hindustan Times<ol><li>Covid-19 vaccine could fundamentally change pandemic direction: WHO  Hindustan Times

</li><li>Oxford COVID-19 trial will lo…British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca plc's (NASDAQ: AZN) COVID-19 vaccine developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford is safe and triggers a similar immune response among all adults, as per the preliminary findings of a peer-reviewed phase two trial, CNBC reports.

What Happened: The peer-reviewed study of 560 participants — 160 aged 18–55 years, 160 aged 56–69 years, and 240 aged 70 years and older — found that immune response among people aged 56-years and higher is the same as that in the 18-55 years age range.

AstraZeneca had previously said that interim data showed their vaccine had produced an immune response in older and younger adults.

The vaccine produced a "T-cell response" within 14 days of the first dose and an antibody response within 28 days of the booster dose. T-cell responses will play a role in long-term immunity against the virus, CNBC noted.

The phase two trials did not confirm the vaccine's efficacy, but the ongoing phase three trials' results are expected this year.

Why It Matters: The co-author of the study at Oxford University, Dr. Maheshi Ramasamy, told CNBC that T-cell responses among older adults were "robust and encouraging" as older adults and people with existing health conditions are at the greatest risk of serious COVID-19 disease.

Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) said that its vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, and Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) confirmed that its vaccine has 95% efficacy.

NEW JERSEY (WABC) -- New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced new restrictions Monday afternoon amid a spike in COVID-19 positivity."A second wave is here," Murphy said. "This is our reality."Starting Nov. 12, restaurants, bars, clubs, lounges must close indoor dining by 10 p.m.The positivity has ticked up to 6%, and the numbers have been going up across the Tri-State area.Murphy told CNBC Monday morning that he "will take some steps," described as "tweaking our parameters at the edges," to help curb rising coronavirus case."They won't come close to what we were doing in the spring," he said. "This is not a lockdown."Casinos in Atlantic City will also not be permitted to serve food or alcohol during those overnight hours.Indoor bar seating had up to this point had been covered under the state's indoor dining regulations, but it will now be prohibited.The new restrictions, which will take effect Thursday, will not affect outdoor dining. Restaurants will be able to continue building out their outdoor dining, including setting up outdoor igloos.Restaurants and bars are already limited to 25% indoor capacity, a restriction that is not expected to change.Addressing indoor sports tournaments spreading the virus across state lines, the state will ban indoor interstate sports for elementary, middle and high school students. College and professional sports will not be affected.The rules are being put into effect two weeks before Thanksgiving to combat indoor dining spread during the holiday season.Private indoor gatherings remain the state's primary concern, but lacking enforcement power in private homes, the state will continue to ask residents to keep gatherings to immediate family members.The state has had infection rates as high as 8% within this past week.He will detail the changes in restrictions at 1 p.m. in Trenton.Murphy also discussed news that Pfizer's vaccine may be 90% effective , according to preliminary data, urging caution.He said that while the trials are "really, really good news," its six-month vaccine distribution timeline will not change the state's short-term reality."We are sort of in a six-month window here...where we have to battle against the COVID fatigue, stop letting our hair down with holidays coming up," he said. "So the answer is it doesn't change us in that window, but it's really really good news in the longer term."State Health Commissioner Judith Perisichelli told "60 Minutes" Sunday night that the first batch of vaccine from the federal government will be enough to inoculate just 10% of the state's high priority health care worker category.She said a state survey of health care members found 60% of the physicians would get the vaccine, and just 40% of nurses.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy takes aim at indoor dining, bars, casinos amid rising coronavirus rates - WABC-TV<ol><li>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy takes aim at indoor dining, bars, casinos amid rising coronavirus rates  WABC-TV

Following are reactions to the news.

ANNA BLAKNEY, RESEARCH FELLOW AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON’S DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PART OF IMPERIAL’S COVID VACCINE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

“I think the results from Moderna are equally exciting - the protection is very similar to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. While the formulation only needs to be frozen at -20C, which makes distribution less of a logistical nightmare, the dose of mRNA they use is much higher (100 µg) so this may impact the rate at which they’re able to produce doses.”

PROF. BODO PLACHTER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGIE, MAINZ UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL, GERMANY

“Moderna has the advantage (over Pfizer) that they can already provide detailed findings on aspects such as severe disease, age and side effects.

“The question remains: What will protection look like after three, six or 12 months. It is fair to assume that it will last at least a year but we can’t be sure at this point.

“The side effects are within a range that would be expected of many other vaccines, such as shingles vaccine Shingrix.”

WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

“Now we know that the vaccine appears to be highly effective. It also seems like we really need the vaccine right now, because we have no coherent national strategy. And the next two months are looking dismal. So there, there has to be some willingness for uncertainty and flexibility in times of crisis... FDA can safely schedule this committee sometime soon.

“If you look at the state of the pandemic right now, and the exponential rise and the stress on the healthcare system, and the assumption that that’s going to get worse, the rising cases in nursing home, the Thanksgiving holiday, and later Christmas holiday and other holidays, all of that is an environment, that it’s just going to add fuel to the fire... with the rate things are moving and the holidays, actually two or three weeks, I think makes a big difference right now.”

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, THE TOP U.S. INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT, SAID ON A CALL WITH REPORTERS:

“The vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Fauci urged Americans not to let their guard down because of this news, but to continue washing hands, avoiding crowds and being vigilant about social distancing.

ZOLTAN KIS, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE FUTURE VACCINE MANUFACTURING HUB, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

“If mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 gain regulatory approval, this will be a huge validation of the RNA vaccine production platform technology.

“Using this technology, vaccine candidates can be produced substantially faster in the future to combat virtually any infectious disease, by producing vaccines against both existing pathogens and future, currently unknown pathogens.

“Vaccine candidates can be produced against virtually any disease, because this is a platform technology, meaning that the production process, the purification processes and the formulation processes can remain the same no matter what vaccine or vaccine candidate is produced.

“This is a huge advantage in terms of the speed at which vaccine candidates can be developed and produced in the future.

“In the case of conventional vaccine production technologies, each vaccine required the development of a new production process, whereas in the case of the RNA vaccine production platform technology one process can produce vaccines and vaccine candidates against virtually any disease.”

PENNY WARD, VISITING PROFESSOR IN PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE AT KING’S COLLEGE LONDON AND CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION AND STANDARDS COMMITTEE OF THE FACULTY OF PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE

“Given the general similarity of the vaccine target and the immunological responses observed for all vaccines, these data generally suggest that vaccination will protect against severe illness and thereby should protect people from needing hospitalization or from dying from COVID.

“We still need to know if there is protection against infection, as the latter leads to herd protection while protection against illness has a value for an individual it will not prevent circulation of virus and risk of disease in unvaccinated persons, or in people not responding adequately to vaccination.”

RICHARD HATCHETT, CEO OF THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS (CEPI)

(CEPI was set up in 2017 to fight emerging epidemics and is backed by 14 governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Britain’s Wellcome Trust)

“The Moderna results are as good as we could have hoped for and really terrifically encouraging.

“Moderna has also released information which suggests that the vaccine may protect against more severe disease (although they don’t address the statistical significance of this finding), and the reported side effects appear to be manageable.

“The fact that the vaccine shows stability when stored in a normal refrigerator for up to 30 days is also terrific news and will allow the vaccine to be distributed broadly.”

ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL

“This vaccine would be much easier to transport and administer than the one from Pfizer. Also the preliminary evidence suggests that it can prevent severe COVID-19 disease. However the Moderna vaccine is more expensive and there are fewer doses available in the next year.”

“No vaccine company has enough supplies available to protect everyone in need. We will need all the available vaccines with over 90% efficacy to cover global demand.”

ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH

“Although the numbers are small, this trial also gives an indication that vaccination is effective in older and BAME individuals and prevents severe disease, all of which are key to allowing the world to start opening up again. The absolute prerequisite for a COVID-19 vaccine is that it stops people becoming ill enough to require hospital treatment and stops people dying. The preliminary data reported here suggest that this vaccine – and by extension, the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine – will achieve this goal.

“The safety data also look promising. The side effects of vaccination appear to be in line with those typically seen for other adult vaccinations, including the seasonal influenza vaccination which is administered in many millions of doses every year.

“One important unknown is whether this vaccine, or any of the vaccines currently in trials, prevents disease transmission. It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don’t yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities.

“But, overall, this is excellent news. Having more than one source of an effective vaccine will increase the global supply and, with luck, help us all to get back to something like normal sometime in 2021.”

PROF TRUDIE LANG, DIRECTOR, THE GLOBAL HEALTH NETWORK, NUFFIELD DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

“It is very good news indeed to see another vaccine coming through with similar efficacy results as were reported last week from Pfizer. This is also an interim analysis, which means that there were enough cases within the vaccinated volunteers to give statistical significance and allow the team to break the blind to determine who had the active vaccine and who had placebo.

“Here they found that of 95 cases of COVID, 90 had received the placebo and five the active vaccine. These early results suggest that there was a representation across different age groups and diverse communities in the protected group. This is really encouraging and it further demonstrates that a vaccine for COVID is a real probability and that having more than one supplier should help assure better and more equitable global availability.

“This vaccine is also an mRNA vaccine, so many of the same questions remain as we have been discussing with the Pfizer vaccine and these will be looked at carefully by the regulators.”

STEPHEN EVANS, PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE & TROPICAL MEDICINE

“This announcement from Moderna is a further encouragement that vaccines will be found to not only have an acceptable efficacy, but an efficacy that is much greater than we had anticipated. This press release is more specific than that of others, in that it confirms the numbers in each group, which was able to be guessed at but to have it confirmed is helpful.

“The range of minor adverse effects reported are unsurprising and typical of almost any vaccine. These reactions tend to be local to where the injection was given and are rarely long-lasting or severe.

“Although they reported efficacy being over 94%, there is statistical uncertainty in this; but based on these data, the likely efficacy will be better than 85% which would be greater than most scientists would have expected.

“This is the first study to report on severe cases and, while uncertainty remains, the finding of no severe cases with the vaccine and 11 cases with placebo is very strong evidence that the vaccine prevents severe as well as mild disease. It is likely that convincing evidence in respect to deaths will probably only be obtained when the vaccine is in use.

“A wide range of people with illnesses and from minority groups were included in the trials as well as substantial numbers of older patients. We will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress.”

PETER OPENSHAW, PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

“This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months.”

“This latest press release is based on a study of 30,000 U.S. adults, including many high-risk or elderly persons. This gives us confidence that the results are relevant in the people who are most at risk of COVID-19 and in most need of the vaccines.”

“Moderna have also announced that the vaccine can be kept in a conventional freezer (-20 degrees Celsius) for up to 6 months, and that once thawed the vaccine can be kept for up to 30 days at standard refrigerator (2 to 8 degrees centigrade). This makes the vaccine much easier to deliver.

“In terms of side effects, news is also quite good. The first dose caused injection site pain in about 3% of people; the second dose was associated with transient generalized symptoms in about 10% of people with fatigue, muscle aches and flu like symptoms. This seems to indicate that they got the dose about right with acceptable adverse events. These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response.”

“We need more complete details than we have in this press release, but this announcement adds to the general feeling of optimism about vaccines for Covid-19. What we still don’t know is how long any protective immunity may last. For that, we will need to wait.”

Corporate reaction:

ALBERT BOURLA, CEO OF PFIZER, SAID ON TWITTER:

“I am thrilled to hear the good news coming out of @moderna_tx’s #COVID19 vaccine development programme. Our companies share a common goal – defeating this dreaded disease – and today we congratulate everyone at Moderna and share in the joy of their encouraging results.”

KIRILL DMITRIEV, CEO OF RUSSIA’S RDIF, WHICH IS MARKETING RUSSIA’S SPUTNIK V VACCINE, WAS QUOTED ON SPUTNIK V TWITTER FEED:

“Very pleased with positive news from Moderna, the world needs a portfolio of vaccines. Vaccines with 90% plus efficiency are very promising, can save lives and restore economic growth”.

Political reaction:

U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID ON TWITTER:

“Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great “historians”, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”

U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN SAID ON TWITTER:

“Today’s news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful.”

“What was true with the first vaccine remains true with the second: we are still months away. Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control.”

ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES, SAID ON TWITTER:

“This news is another stunning result of President Trump’s leadership and his unwavering support for #OperationWarpSpeed, an incredible tribute to American scientists and innovators, and one more reminder that there is light at the end of the tunnel.”

FRANCIS COLLINS, DIRECTOR OF U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, SAID IN A MEDIA CALL

“This really is a significant milestone, two Monday mornings in a row with remarkable results to report of interim analysis of COVID-19 vaccine trials.

“As Tony Fauci has said, that means the cavalry is coming.”

Market reaction:

BRAD LONCAR, HEALTHCARE INVESTOR, CEO OF LONCAR INVESTMENTS, KANSAS CITY

“It’s really incredible to think back to January and February, messenger RNA was a totally unproven technology for anything, let alone vaccines. And you have to give a lot of credit to these companies. And you have to give a lot of credit to Dr. Fauci. It was a big bet - it was a risky thing to bet on.

“It’s hugely important that now two vaccines have succeeded, instead of just one. The entire country and the entire world is going to need to get vaccinated one day, and we need many vaccines. We need more than just these two to succeed, because we’re going to be capacity constrained.

“(Moderna and Pfizer) should be filing for approval within the next two to three weeks. And I think it’s fair to say that both of these will likely be approved in early to mid December. And I think that the first group - healthcare workers and people like that - will be vaccinated before the end of the year.

“To the extent that the Moderna one makes it easier logistically to deliver and specifically store, that’s a hugely important thing. Probably the people who will benefit most from it are people who traditionally don’t have the highest access to healthcare - people in rural areas or poorer countries.”Expert Views: Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 - Reuters<ol><li>Expert Views: Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19  Reuters

Following are reactions to the news.

ANNA BLAKNEY, RESEARCH FELLOW AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON’S DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PART OF IMPERIAL’S COVID VACCINE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

“I think the results from Moderna are equally exciting - the protection is very similar to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. While the formulation only needs to be frozen at -20C, which makes distribution less of a logistical nightmare, the dose of mRNA they use is much higher (100 µg) so this may impact the rate at which they’re able to produce doses.”

PROF. BODO PLACHTER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGIE, MAINZ UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL, GERMANY

“Moderna has the advantage (over Pfizer) that they can already provide detailed findings on aspects such as severe disease, age and side effects.

“The question remains: What will protection look like after three, six or 12 months. It is fair to assume that it will last at least a year but we can’t be sure at this point.

“The side effects are within a range that would be expected of many other vaccines, such as shingles vaccine Shingrix.”

WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

“Now we know that the vaccine appears to be highly effective. It also seems like we really need the vaccine right now, because we have no coherent national strategy. And the next two months are looking dismal. So there, there has to be some willingness for uncertainty and flexibility in times of crisis... FDA can safely schedule this committee sometime soon.

“If you look at the state of the pandemic right now, and the exponential rise and the stress on the healthcare system, and the assumption that that’s going to get worse, the rising cases in nursing home, the Thanksgiving holiday, and later Christmas holiday and other holidays, all of that is an environment, that it’s just going to add fuel to the fire... with the rate things are moving and the holidays, actually two or three weeks, I think makes a big difference right now.”

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, THE TOP U.S. INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT, SAID ON A CALL WITH REPORTERS:

“The vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Fauci urged Americans not to let their guard down because of this news, but to continue washing hands, avoiding crowds and being vigilant about social distancing.

ZOLTAN KIS, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE FUTURE VACCINE MANUFACTURING HUB, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

“If mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 gain regulatory approval, this will be a huge validation of the RNA vaccine production platform technology.

“Using this technology, vaccine candidates can be produced substantially faster in the future to combat virtually any infectious disease, by producing vaccines against both existing pathogens and future, currently unknown pathogens.

“Vaccine candidates can be produced against virtually any disease, because this is a platform technology, meaning that the production process, the purification processes and the formulation processes can remain the same no matter what vaccine or vaccine candidate is produced.

“This is a huge advantage in terms of the speed at which vaccine candidates can be developed and produced in the future.

“In the case of conventional vaccine production technologies, each vaccine required the development of a new production process, whereas in the case of the RNA vaccine production platform technology one process can produce vaccines and vaccine candidates against virtually any disease.”

PENNY WARD, VISITING PROFESSOR IN PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE AT KING’S COLLEGE LONDON AND CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION AND STANDARDS COMMITTEE OF THE FACULTY OF PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE

“Given the general similarity of the vaccine target and the immunological responses observed for all vaccines, these data generally suggest that vaccination will protect against severe illness and thereby should protect people from needing hospitalization or from dying from COVID.

“We still need to know if there is protection against infection, as the latter leads to herd protection while protection against illness has a value for an individual it will not prevent circulation of virus and risk of disease in unvaccinated persons, or in people not responding adequately to vaccination.”

RICHARD HATCHETT, CEO OF THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS (CEPI)

(CEPI was set up in 2017 to fight emerging epidemics and is backed by 14 governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Britain’s Wellcome Trust)

“The Moderna results are as good as we could have hoped for and really terrifically encouraging.

“Moderna has also released information which suggests that the vaccine may protect against more severe disease (although they don’t address the statistical significance of this finding), and the reported side effects appear to be manageable.

“The fact that the vaccine shows stability when stored in a normal refrigerator for up to 30 days is also terrific news and will allow the vaccine to be distributed broadly.”

ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL

“This vaccine would be much easier to transport and administer than the one from Pfizer. Also the preliminary evidence suggests that it can prevent severe COVID-19 disease. However the Moderna vaccine is more expensive and there are fewer doses available in the next year.”

“No vaccine company has enough supplies available to protect everyone in need. We will need all the available vaccines with over 90% efficacy to cover global demand.”

ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH

“Although the numbers are small, this trial also gives an indication that vaccination is effective in older and BAME individuals and prevents severe disease, all of which are key to allowing the world to start opening up again. The absolute prerequisite for a COVID-19 vaccine is that it stops people becoming ill enough to require hospital treatment and stops people dying. The preliminary data reported here suggest that this vaccine – and by extension, the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine – will achieve this goal.

“The safety data also look promising. The side effects of vaccination appear to be in line with those typically seen for other adult vaccinations, including the seasonal influenza vaccination which is administered in many millions of doses every year.

“One important unknown is whether this vaccine, or any of the vaccines currently in trials, prevents disease transmission. It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don’t yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities.

“But, overall, this is excellent news. Having more than one source of an effective vaccine will increase the global supply and, with luck, help us all to get back to something like normal sometime in 2021.”

PROF TRUDIE LANG, DIRECTOR, THE GLOBAL HEALTH NETWORK, NUFFIELD DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

“It is very good news indeed to see another vaccine coming through with similar efficacy results as were reported last week from Pfizer. This is also an interim analysis, which means that there were enough cases within the vaccinated volunteers to give statistical significance and allow the team to break the blind to determine who had the active vaccine and who had placebo.

“Here they found that of 95 cases of COVID, 90 had received the placebo and five the active vaccine. These early results suggest that there was a representation across different age groups and diverse communities in the protected group. This is really encouraging and it further demonstrates that a vaccine for COVID is a real probability and that having more than one supplier should help assure better and more equitable global availability.

“This vaccine is also an mRNA vaccine, so many of the same questions remain as we have been discussing with the Pfizer vaccine and these will be looked at carefully by the regulators.”

STEPHEN EVANS, PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE & TROPICAL MEDICINE

“This announcement from Moderna is a further encouragement that vaccines will be found to not only have an acceptable efficacy, but an efficacy that is much greater than we had anticipated. This press release is more specific than that of others, in that it confirms the numbers in each group, which was able to be guessed at but to have it confirmed is helpful.

“The range of minor adverse effects reported are unsurprising and typical of almost any vaccine. These reactions tend to be local to where the injection was given and are rarely long-lasting or severe.

“Although they reported efficacy being over 94%, there is statistical uncertainty in this; but based on these data, the likely efficacy will be better than 85% which would be greater than most scientists would have expected.

“This is the first study to report on severe cases and, while uncertainty remains, the finding of no severe cases with the vaccine and 11 cases with placebo is very strong evidence that the vaccine prevents severe as well as mild disease. It is likely that convincing evidence in respect to deaths will probably only be obtained when the vaccine is in use.

“A wide range of people with illnesses and from minority groups were included in the trials as well as substantial numbers of older patients. We will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress.”

PETER OPENSHAW, PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

“This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months.”

WHO says no time for COVID complacency despite vaccine news - Reuters UKThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that there is no time for complacency in confronting the coronavirus despite positive news about possible vaccines.GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed Moderna reporting on Monday that its experimental vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy but said that “many questions” remained and it was no time for complacency.

Only very limited amounts of any vaccine will be available in the first half of 2021 for people other than priority health workers, WHO officials said.

“While we continue to receive encouraging news about COVID-19 vaccines and remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for new tools to start to arrive in coming months, right now we are extremely concerned by the surge in cases we are seeing in some countries, particularly in Europe and the Americas,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing.

It marked his return to the Geneva agency from quarantine after being exposed to coronavirus some 17 days ago. Tedros said he had no symptoms and had seen no need for a test.

Moderna Inc’s experimental vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, the company said on Monday, becoming the second U.S. drugmaker to report results that far exceed expectations.

Together with Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, which is also more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available this year.

Soumya Swaminathan, WHO’s chief scientist, said that the Moderna results were “quite encouraging”. Its final efficacy and safety profile would still be needed, as well as follow-up on trial participants for two months for any side effects.

Pfizer and Moderna candidate vaccines both use mRNA technology and appear to achieve high efficacy, she added.

“But there are many, many questions still remaining about the duration of protection, the impact on severe disease, the impact on different sub-populations especially the elderly, as well as the adverse events beyond a certain period of time,” Swaminathan said.

Clinical trials must continue to collect more data, she said, adding that more results were expected in coming weeks from the other vaccine trials.

“We are looking at at least the first half of the year as being a period with very very limited doses. Supplies are going to be limited, there are bilateral deals that many of the companies have done, so many of the doses have already been booked by some countries,” Swaminathan said.

Moderna is a two-dose vaccine and its delivery means, as well as storage, were also important considerations, said Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s immunisation department.

“We will be looking really carefully at the ease at which different vaccines can be delivered and certainly about the number of doses that are required,” she said.WHO says no time for COVID complacency despite vaccine news - Reuters UKThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that there is no time for complacency in confronting the coronavirus despite positive news about possible vaccines.GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed Moderna reporting on Monday that its experimental vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy but said that “many questions” remained and it was no time for complacency.

Economics & Politics as a Lens on MarketsIt’s that time in the electoral calendar cycle where the media turns aggressively towards the economic and political news as their default filter. I have had numerous conversations with folks at various media outlets, about pandemic, the economy, the election…It’s that time in the electoral calendar cycle where the media turns aggressively towards the economic and political news as their default filter. I have had numerous conversations with folks at various media outlets, about the pandemic, economy, election, and markets — including what investors should do now. This is a written version of various conversations I have held the past week:

~~~

Q: How should investors play the election?

BR: They should vote — that is it!

For our clients, with broad holdings across diverse asset classes, their portfolios are indifferent to the outcome of the election. The current “Risk On/Risk Off” binary approach is a risky speculation, not an investment. For typical investors with an investment portfolio and a 401(k)s, It is a pretty silly approach.

Now, if you run a hedge fund or trade specific stocks, the outcome will clearly have different impacts on different sectors. Anything related to alternative energy, low carbon, health care, hospitals and pharmaceuticals will be impacted. But be very careful of leaping to conclusions: Consider for example, Oil and Coal, both championed by President Trump. They have both done very poorly over the past four years. And Technology seems to be doing well, regardless of who has or will be been president.

Q: We see the rise in Covid cases over the weekend and Wall Street reacting to the downside. But you also have the death numbers, which we are still seeing but at a lower rate?

BR: First, try to avoid the narrative fallacy of putting a rational explanation onto the day-to-day randomness of market twists and turns. We are too easily fooled by our own hindsight bias. So my default position on yesterday or today or last week is that the market action is pretty meaningless.

As to Covid: The good news is mortality rates have been falling, as new protocols have been implemented. The medical community has put its hard won experience with the disease to work. (Also, as schools open, younger people are getting infected with higher frequency; they have the best survival rates of any demographic group).

The bad news is the second wave we have been warned about is ramping up. We have opened up more of the economy, but not well or intelligently. Look at how South Korea has handled it for a better example of a large advanced democracy managing it better. Or if you want something culturally/geographically more similar to us, then see Canada to our North — their mortality rate is half of ours in the US. New Zealand may be small, but they have become the gold standard in how to respond to a pandemic.

As the weather gets colder, people will be are indoors more – and that seems to be a bad vector for transmission.

Q: Does the information about big pharma and potential vaccines still have the same impact?

BR: The change seems very reminiscent of the early days of the Iraq War. The first time a mosque was accidentally bombed or some other horrific war news of collateral damage was released, markets sold off hard in reaction. By the 6th time, traders had become mostly inured to the noise, and markets merely shrugged.

The latest data on the Covid19 vaccines is it won’t be like Measles, Polio, or Smallpox, which run close to a 100% effectiveness rate. Instead, the range is between 50% and 70%. But masks are 95%. The takeaway from that is vaccines won’t be a magic bullet. The combination of Masks and Vaccines will allow us to start getting back to normal. But I suspect we will be dealing with Coronavirus for the next 4-5 years.

I see two investing questions: First, how much of this is already baked into each sector? And second, what edge do you have in selecting any specific company as the Covid Vaccine winner? (I do not believe I posses any unique insight or special edge, so I steer clear of trying to guess which company will win the vaccine lottery).

Q: Then you also have the Presidential election and all of the tension being brought forward… It seems like Wall Street is starting to adjust for the potential of a Biden Presidency, which would most likely include higher taxes and a shift in the economy that we saw the last few years…

At risk of engaging in the sort of narrative fallacy I cautioned about above, let’s discuss three things investors really love: Low rates/low inflation (Monetary Stimulus), Tax Cuts, and Fiscal Stimulus. We already have low rates/ inflation, and a Blue Wave election will likely mean a LOT of fiscal stimulus. Investors will like that short term.

Taxes and Regulations are potentially long-term headwinds — higher corporate tax — 21% going up to 28%, possibly with a AMT rate of 19%. Individuals making more than $400k will see an increase, too. Still lower than prior positive eras for the markets like 1993-2000 or 2009-16.

Modest regulations like CAFE standards and undoing environmental deregulation (e.g., restricting chemical dumping) are not a worry; it is the more aggressive regulations that raise more concerns for some investors. The biggest concern among some traders and investors: a financial transaction tax. That would be potentially “very challenging” according to some; it could be a drag on long term market returns. Even worse, it is invisible to taxpayers, making the temptation to go back repeatedly a substantial risk factor.

Q: Does Wall Street think about the amount of debt that the country has accumulated, especially during this pandemic?

I have been hearing about he dangers of government debt my entire adult life, and at least so far, it has proven to be utter nonsense. It is cudgel used by those out of power to limit the influence those in power. If we have learned anything about Faux Deficit Hawks, it is they are intellectually dishonest and hypocritical frauds. During a recession or crisis, we should not care at all about deficits. Counter-cyclical deficit spending is fine, especially when paired with pro-cyclical deficit reduction.

Q: You mentioned recently on your website that 2 in 3 Europeans have a negative view of the U-S… what impact does that have on our economy?

Look at it in terms of international relations and economically: The impact is on foreign affairs is our diminishing ability to fashion a coalition to respond as a group to an outside threat. Post WW2, America was thew de facto leader of the free world, a bulwark against communist expansion, and a the shining example of the benefits of democracy. We seem to have lost our way in those areas; I am hoping that it is temporary.

Economically, we have an enormous tourist industry catering to overseas visitors; and our entertainment — music, tv, movies, theater, etc — is a global export. We don’t want to see those areas become less viable due to political backlash.Economics & Politics as a Lens on MarketsIt’s that time in the electoral calendar cycle where the media turns aggressively towards the economic and political news as their default filter.

At risk of engaging in the sort of narrative fallacy I cautioned about above, let’s discuss three things investors really love: Low rates/low inflation (Monetary Stimulus), Tax Cuts, and Fiscal Stimulus. We already have low rates/ inflation, and a Blue Wave election will likely mean a LOT of fiscal stimulus. Investors will like that short term.

Taxes and Regulations are potentially long-term headwinds — higher corporate tax — 21% going up to 28%, possibly with a AMT rate of 19%. Individuals making more than $400k will see an increase, too. Still lower than prior positive eras for the markets like 1993-2000 or 2009-16.

Modest regulations like CAFE standards and undoing environmental deregulation (e.g., restricting chemical dumping) are not a worry; it is the more aggressive regulations that raise more concerns for some investors. The biggest concern among some traders and investors: a financial transaction tax. That would be potentially “very challenging” according to some; it could be a drag on long term market returns. Even worse, it is invisible to taxpayers, making the temptation to go back repeatedly a substantial risk factor.

Q: Does Wall Street think about the amount of debt that the country has accumulated, especially during this pandemic?

I have been hearing about he dangers of government debt my entire adult life, and at least so far, it has proven to be utter nonsense. It is cudgel used by those out of power to limit the influence those in power. If we have learned anything about Faux Deficit Hawks, it is they are intellectually dishonest and hypocritical frauds. During a recession or crisis, we should not care at all about deficits. Counter-cyclical deficit spending is fine, especially when paired with pro-cyclical deficit reduction.

Q: You mentioned recently on your website that 2 in 3 Europeans have a negative view of the U-S… what impact does that have on our economy?

Look at it in terms of international relations and economically: The impact is on foreign affairs is our diminishing ability to fashion a coalition to respond as a group to an outside threat. Post WW2, America was thew de facto leader of the free world, a bulwark against communist expansion, and a the shining example of the benefits of democracy. We seem to have lost our way in those areas; I am hoping that it is temporary.

Economically, we have an enormous tourist industry catering to overseas visitors; and our entertainment — music, tv, movies, theater, etc — is a global export. We don’t want to see those areas become less viable due to political backlash.



Vaccine safety monitoring in the age of the COVID-19 pandemicLast year, the Trump administration essentially disbanded the National Vaccine Program Office, folding it into an office focused on infectious diseases. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. What does this mean for monitoring the safety of the new COVID-19 vaccines…Shares

Vaccine safety has long been a major topic on this blog for a number of reasons, not the least of which is to counter the longstanding efforts of the antivaccine movement to cast doubt on vaccine safety. Many health problems have been falsely linked vaccines such as MMR (and, previously, the thimerosal preservative that used to be in several childhood vaccines) and autism, or demonstrably incorrect claims that vaccines predispose babies to sudden infant death syndrome, or autoimmune disease, or infertility and premature ovarian failure in females, or obesity, and a whole host of other conditions, diseases, and problems up to and including cancer and death. It doesn’t matter that vaccines are effective and among the safest of medical interventions. (They have to be, given that they are administered to mass populations of children and adults without disease in order to prevent disease.) Indeed, the benefits of some vaccines go beyond even the diseases that they prevent, diseases that are more dangerous than most people appreciate, such as in the case of the measles vaccine. Most people are unaware of the multiple layers of systems monitoring vaccine safety and the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO), the closing or “reorganization” of which has led me to great concern for the monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety.

Unfortunately, the success of the antivaccine movement in spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about vaccines on social media before social media companies started to crack down (and even after) has led to enough vaccine hesitancy that in a number of areas vaccine uptake has fallen to levels that endanger community immunity (formerly—and, sadly, still sometimes—referred to as herd immunity). Remember last year, when measles outbreaks due to decreasing MMR vaccination rates in various parts of the countries were a major concern, a problem that first burst into the US public consciousness after the Disneyland measles outbreak nearly six years ago? Soon after the pandemic hit, antivaxxers allied themselves with COVID-19 deniers, antimask and anti-lockdown protesters, and all manner of cranks and conspiracy theorists who have flourished during the pandemic and, for example, blamed the flu vaccine for increased susceptibility to COVID-19. This alliance is tight, up to and including the utterly bonkers conspiracy theory QAnon, which believes that President Donald Trump is battling a “deep state” group of Satanic pedophiles who harvest the blood of children for adrenochrome. (Don’t ask.) So it should come as no surprise that, as early as May (and earlier, ancient history in the timeline of the pandemic), antivaxxers started a preemptive disinformation war to cast doubt on any COVID-19 vaccines that will emerge from an unprecedented research effort. The Trump administration didn’t help, either. By naming its COVID-19 vaccine program “Operation Warp Speed,” it not only stoked doubt about whether any new vaccine would be adequately tested for safety, it made even staunch pro-vaccine advocates like me uncomfortable, as the Trump administration politicized the FDA and CDC to the point where I asked if we could trust them any more and, as Jann Bellamy wrote last week, the Government Accountability Office is investigating.

So I was not pleased when I read what happened in terms of vaccine safety monitoring last year.

Trump gutted the National Vaccine Program Office

It was with dismay that I read a story in The New York Times on Friday by Carl Zimmer reporting that last year the Trump Administration shut down a key office responsible for coordinating government programs monitoring vaccine safety and folded it into an office focused on infectious diseases. Noting that the first coronavirus vaccines will likely be approved next year, if not even earlier, and rolled out to millions of people in the US, Zimmer observes:

As the first coronavirus vaccines arrive in the coming year, government researchers will face a monumental challenge: monitoring the health of hundreds of millions of Americans to ensure the vaccines don’t cause harm. Purely by chance, thousands of vaccinated people will have heart attacks, strokes and other illnesses shortly after the injections. Sorting out whether the vaccines had anything to do with their ailments will be a thorny problem, requiring a vast, coordinated effort by state and federal agencies, hospitals, drug makers and insurers to discern patterns in a flood of data. Findings will need to be clearly communicated to a distrustful public swamped with disinformation.

This has, of course, always been the most difficult issue when it comes to monitoring vaccine safety. People are pattern-seeking animals. We’re extremely good at noticing patterns and creating meaning or inferring causation from those patterns, even if the meanings or causations inferred are completely false. One commonly used example to illustrate this point is that if you ate some wild berries and then sickened, it would likely be beneficial to see the link between eating berries and illness, and then to avoid those berries in the future, even if the berries were not, in fact, the cause of the illness. Another commonly used example is early humans on the savannah. Rustling of the grass might indicate that a predator is near and be an indication to flee or get ready to fight, or it might be just the wind. Rapidly concluding that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator when it is actually just the wind doesn’t cost much, but believing that a dangerous predator is just the wind could easily mean that the early human ends up in the belly of a lion. The bottom line is that there likely was selective pressure in evolution against dismissing patterns (or for seeing them), whether they mean what we think they mean or not.

This pattern-seeking behavior is not well-suited to a task like evaluating drug safety. Many of us will conclude, after taking a drug or receiving a vaccine, that anything bad that happens soon afterward was likely caused by the drug or the vaccine, even when it is far more likely that it was random chance (i.e., coincidence), and nothing more. Such is the case with vaccines and autism. The ages during which children receive a lot of vaccines just happens to correspond to the ages where parents most frequently first start noticing the signs of autism spectrum disorders, as can be shown by an estimate of how many cases of autism we would expect to see diagnosed within one week or even 30 days of receiving vaccines. The numbers are much larger than most people would guess. Basically, our brains appear to be hard-wired to find patterns, and we have a hard time accepting that coincidence is very common. That’s why we need data and epidemiology to separate coincidence from actual correlation above what we would expect by random chance alone. It’s also why vaccine safety monitoring systems are so important.

Of course, I began expressing concerns about the likely problems President Trump would cause for science, especially drug approval and safety, beginning even before he took office and then during the first 100 days, such as his including two ultra-libertarians who thought that the FDA should only require evidence of safety and not efficacy before approving a drug, one of whom thought that voluntary reporting systems and the free market alone would be enough to assure the safety of drugs and devices, like a “Yelp” or “Uber” for pharmaceuticals, in his short list for candidates for FDA Commissioner. The third was a bona fide pharma shill, Scott Gottlieb. He was the “least bad” of the three and ultimately became FDA Commissioner. Surprisingly, he was generally not too bad, but unfortunately he only lasted a couple of years.

In any event, the Trump administration is focused on getting COVID-19 vaccines to market, but seems a lot less concerned about what comes next, such as how to distribute the vaccines rapidly and equitably, and how to monitor their longer term safety:

The next job will be to monitor the safety of vaccines once they’re in widespread use. But the administration last year quietly disbanded the office with the expertise for exactly this job, merging it into an office focused on infectious diseases. Its elimination has left that long-term safety effort for coronavirus vaccines fragmented among federal agencies, with no central leadership, experts say. “We’re behind the eight ball,” said Daniel Salmon, who served as the director of vaccine safety in that office from 2007 to 2012, overseeing coordination during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. “We don’t even know who’s in charge.” An H.H.S. spokesperson said that the vaccine office was not shuttered. “The office was not ‘closed,’ but was merged with the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy and was strengthened,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “All the functions continue in this new organizational structure.” In a brief statement, a different spokesperson said that Operation Warp Speed was working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to synchronize the IT systems” involved in monitoring vaccine safety data.

I’ll get into those IT systems in a minute, as I’ve written about them on multiple occasions. First, however, I note that the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP) is an office in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) itself, not the CDC or FDA. A quick search of the almighty Wayback Machine at Archive.org reveals that the crawl of the web page listing the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) as part of OIDP is dated June 11, 2019, implying that the reorganization occurred sometime fairly soon before that. Searching for the NVPO further back on the Wayback Machine revealed web pages (i.e., this version from 2004) with much more robust links. Apparently the NVPO does have a Twitter feed, and it’s retweeting denials by Admiral Brett Giroir, Assistant Secretary for Health:

Irresponsible "journalism" https://t.co/SKCv4iHBcI. The office is NOT closed, but merged with the Infectious Disease Office & strengthened. All functions continue. #NVAC is ACTIVELY meeting, involved, regularly charged, and engaged in #COVID19 vaccine efforts including safety. — ADM Brett P. Giroir (@HHS_ASH) October 23, 2020

But is this true? Given the record of this administration compared to Carl Zimmer’s record as a journalist, I’d be far more inclined to believe Zimmer than Adm. Giroir, to be honest. But first, let’s look at the vaccine safety monitoring systems in place as they were pre-pandemic.

Beyond VAERS …

Antivaxxers love to portray the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) as the be-all and end-all of the databases monitoring vaccine safety. The reason is that VAERS is unique among US vaccine safety reporting systems in that it is a passive surveillance system. It relies on people to submit reports of adverse reactions to vaccines; it doesn’t actively look for them, as active surveillance systems do. Moreover, anyone can submit a report to VAERS , and they do, including parents of autistic children seeking compensation for their children’s autism as being due to “vaccine injury”. Indeed, I long ago discussed how lawyers game VAERS for their litigation, reporting lots of cases of autism as supposedly an “adverse reaction” to vaccines. It’s one reason why those of us who’ve been following the antivaccine movement like to refer to the bad “scientific studies” published by antivaccine physicians and scientists that use VAERS as their data source as “dumpster diving“, for example, this one claiming to find a link between the H1N1 vaccine and miscarriages or one of the earliest examples, Mark and David Geier’s epically bad study trying to link thimerosal-containing vaccines to autism. Meanwhile, in 2006 Jim Laidler infamously reported to VAERS that the flu vaccine had turned him into The Incredible Hulk, and VAERS accepted the report. True, someone did contact him to question it. If Laidler hadn’t been honest, he could have insisted that the report remain, and it would have.

Why would anyone set up a system like VAERS , which is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? First, you must understand that VAERS isn’t intended to give an accurate estimate of the frequency of various adverse events after vaccination. Rather, it was always intended to serve as an early warning system, a “canary in the coalmine”, so to speak. Consequently, even though antivaxxers like to harp on how passive surveillance systems generally capture only a small fraction of adverse reactions, one thing VAERS does do is capture severe reactions. Practically no one is going to report an adverse reaction like a sore arm or transient fever to VAERS , but you know damned well they’ll report more serious ones, such as a seizure. The problem is that the natural human tendency to seek patterns, coupled with the way antivaccine lawyers game VAERS by having their clients report all sorts of spurious “adverse events” to the database after vaccination, means that VAERS is a very noisy, distorted, and unreliable database. Still, it has its place if you understand its intended purpose. That purpose, contrary to what antivaxxers would have you believe, is not as the be-all and end-all of vaccine safety surveillance. It is primarily a hypothesis-generating, not hypothesis-testing, system when it comes to questions related to vaccine safety. To test the correlations found in VAERS requires different systems, systems such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).

Antivaxxers sometimes mention VSD, but often labor under the delusion that it is not an automatic surveillance system. It is:

The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) is a collaborative project between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and eight health care organizations. The VSD started in 1990 and continues today in order to monitor safety of vaccines and conduct studies about rare and serious adverse events following immunization. The VSD uses electronic health data from each participating site. This includes information on vaccines: the kind of vaccine given to each patient, date of vaccination, and other vaccinations given on the same day. The VSD also uses information on medical illnesses that have been diagnosed at doctors’ offices, urgent care visits, emergency department visits, and hospital stays. The VSD conducts vaccine safety studies based on questions or concerns raised from the medical literature and reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ). When there are new vaccines that have been recommended for use in the United States or if there are changes in how a vaccine is recommended, the VSD will monitor the safety of these vaccines.

So VSD is run by the CDC, meaning that it’s not part of this reorganization or shuttering or folding of NVPO into OIDP. Its strengths include being an active surveillance system that contains very granular data, given its tight affiliation with Kaiser Permanente in California, its Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA), which allows it to identify adverse events following vaccination in near real time, and its data sharing and collaboration with other scientists outside of the CDC and the involved health care organizations. As an aside, it was an attempt to merge datasets from the VSD in a manner that would compromise the privacy of patients whose data were in the datasets that got antivaxxers Mark and David Geier into trouble so long ago.

Then, there are two active surveillance systems that cover vaccines. First, there is the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project, in which the CDC partners with several large academic medical centers and Kaiser Permanente Northern California to study vaccine safety:

CISA addresses vaccine safety issues, conducts high quality clinical research, and assesses complex clinical adverse events following vaccination. CISA facilitates CDC’s collaboration with vaccine safety experts at leading academic medical centers and strengthens national capacity for vaccine safety monitoring. The CISA Project provides consultation to US clinicians who have vaccine safety questions about a specific patient residing in the US. In addition, CISA provides consultation to US healthcare providers and public health partners on vaccine safety issues, and reviews clinical adverse events following immunization (AEFI) involving the US-licensed vaccines.

Second, there is FDA’s Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System (PRISM):

The word “prism” might make you think of a triangular piece of glass that separates white light into a rainbow of colors. But at FDA, it means a powerful, computer-based system that separates critical bits of information from vast streams of healthcare data in order to investigate adverse events and determine if there is a connection to a specific vaccine. And while the FDA prism–called Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System (PRISM)—might not have such a colorful name, it’s a bright light in the agency’s continual efforts to identify adverse effects in a timely manner. PRISM is a cooperative effort between FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and its partners in the health care and medical insurance communities. It analyzes health insurance claims data from four national healthcare plans: Aetna, HealthCore (Wellpoint), Humana, and OptumInsight (United Healthcare).

And:

PRISM is one component of FDA’s Sentinel Initiative, which monitors the safety of a variety of FDA-regulated medical products by examining information in electronic healthcare databases. Sentinel performs what is called “active” surveillance, as opposed to “passive” surveillance. Passive FDA surveillance systems depend on industry, consumers, patients, and healthcare professionals to recognize and report suspected adverse events to an FDA web site, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ). This means that FDA might not become aware of potential problems related to a licensed product for months. Unlike passive surveillance, Sentinel’s active surveillance lets FDA initiate its own studies using existing electronic healthcare data in a timely manner. Sentinel also lets FDA evaluate safety issues in targeted groups, such as children, or to evaluate specific conditions (e.g., heart attacks) that are not usually reported as possible adverse events of medical products through passive reporting systems.

In summary, VSD uses real medical records, while PRISM and CISA are active surveillance systems. Contrary to what antivaxxers claim, there are at least four systems to monitor vaccine safety, two of which are active surveillance systems. Unfortunately, PRISM is no longer being used to its potential, as Zimmer reports.

What does the transfer of NVPO to OIDP mean?

Reading Zimmer’s article profoundly depressed me, because it just demonstrated to me yet again how little this administration cares for science. In particular, Zimmer mentioned the effective use of PRISM as a potential casualty of the transfer of NVPO to OIDP. First, Zimmer describes how PRISM came about:

In 1990, the C.D.C. set up a new way to track vaccines that didn’t depend on people coming forward. The agency worked with health care organizations to get updates on people’s medical conditions. That system now covers 12 million people. Researchers can use it to look for clusters of symptoms that arise in people who get the same vaccine. When the H1N1 flu hit in 2009, Dr. Salmon recognized that these methods didn’t track enough people to quickly pick up rare symptoms. He reached out to researchers at Harvard to build a new system, which came to be known as PRISM. Ten states supplied vaccination records, and five health insurance companies shared anonymous information about 38 million members. PRISM then connected the two databases to track insurance claims in the wake of vaccination. “That really gave us a ton of data,” Dr. Salmon said. The researchers could come up with a background rate of a host of medical conditions. If the H1N1 vaccine was linked to cases that matched the background rate, they could dismiss the symptoms as ordinary. Only if they rose above the background rate would they be considered unusual and warrant a closer look.

As Zimmer notes, the vast majority of reports turned out not to be correlated with vaccines, citing the example of some vaccinated people developing Bell’s palsy and how researchers were able to exclude vaccines as a cause within two weeks using PRISM. Now, for reasons that are unclear, PRISM appears to be no longer used to look for rare vaccine adverse events, the FDA using it only to monitor drug safety now:

The other systems can provide safety information much faster, but they’re small compared with the PRISM system, which now covers about 60 million people. The F.D.A. still uses PRISM for drug safety research, but not for vaccines. Dr. Salmon is baffled that the agency hasn’t tapped into it again. “Why would you not use that?” he asked. (An agency spokeswoman said it might use PRISM in the future should the need arise.)

Worse, though, is that there now appears to be a lack of coordination once provided by NVPO now that it has been folded into OIDP:

But Dr. Nicole Lurie, who was assistant secretary for preparedness and response at H.H.S. during the 2009 pandemic, said the loss of the vaccine safety office was especially costly once the coronavirus pandemic hit. “The coordinated leadership for stuff like this would likely come from the National Vaccine Program Office,” she said. Dr. Lurie, now an adviser at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, has been waiting along with other researchers, month after month, for coordinated leadership to emerge from the federal government on long-term vaccine safety. “There are a whole bunch of people who were really concerned about this,” she said. An F.D.A. official who declined to be identified said that in the absence of the National Vaccine Program Office, F.D.A. and C.D.C. staff members were relying on relationships they had built across the agencies, meeting regularly to discuss their separate projects. That leaderless effort concerns Dr. Lurie. “There’s no sort of active coordination to bring all the information together,” she said.

Given the track record of the Trump administration, I fear that scientists intensely interested in vaccine safety will have to wait a long time for coordinated leadership. If there’s one thing that is clear about this administration, even among those who support it, it’s that coordinated leadership really isn’t something it’s particularly good at.

Meanwhile, on Thursday an expert from the CDC and one from the FDA gave presentations about monitoring systems at the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, describing one that will use smartphone apps to monitor health care workers and other essential workers after vaccination, with another looking at a database of insurance claims and electronic health records, with a third looking at data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid data to track people over 65 for adverse events after vaccination. None of these are as comprehensive as PRISM.

From my perspective, it’s hard for me to tell how much of this latest development in which the role of a key office for vaccine safety monitoring has apparently been much diminished in a “reorganization” (or whatever you want to call it) is due to incompetence or the hyperpoliticization of agencies that were intended to be apolitical. Could administration spokespeople claiming that NVPO is just as relevant and active as ever be correct? Who knows? I suppose it’s possible, but the statements of so many public health experts expressing alarm definitely give me pause.

Here’s what worries me, regardless of who wins the election. By the time COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out and distributed next year (at the earliest), the HHS, CDC, and FDA will have been “reorganized” and stripped of so much expertise through a brain drain resulting from the demoralization caused by so much incompetence and political interference that it will be very difficult for the CDC and FDA to monitor the safety of the new vaccines effectively. Even if Joe Biden wins, he can’t do anything before January 20, 2021, and it will take many months, if not several years to reverse the damage. As hard as it is to believe now, one day the pandemic will end. After that (no, even now) we have to worry about all the other routine vaccines, in particular how much confidence in vaccines will have eroded due to a distrust of the COVID-19 vaccine, the general incompetence and hostility to regulation of the current administration, and the unholy union of COVID-19 deniers, antivaxxers, and QAnon conspiracy theorists.Vaccine safety monitoring in the age of the COVID-19 pandemicLast year, the Trump administration essentially disbanded the National Vaccine Program Office, folding it into an office focused on infectious diseases.

Irresponsible "journalism" https://t.co/SKCv4iHBcI. The office is NOT closed, but merged with the Infectious Disease Office & strengthened. All functions continue. #NVAC is ACTIVELY meeting, involved, regularly charged, and engaged in #COVID19 vaccine efforts including safety. — ADM Brett P. Giroir (@HHS_ASH) October 23, 2020

But is this true? Given the record of this administration compared to Carl Zimmer’s record as a journalist, I’d be far more inclined to believe Zimmer than Adm. Giroir, to be honest. But first, let’s look at the vaccine safety monitoring systems in place as they were pre-pandemic.

Beyond VAERS …

Antivaxxers love to portray the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) as the be-all and end-all of the databases monitoring vaccine safety. The reason is that VAERS is unique among US vaccine safety reporting systems in that it is a passive surveillance system. It relies on people to submit reports of adverse reactions to vaccines; it doesn’t actively look for them, as active surveillance systems do. Moreover, anyone can submit a report to VAERS , and they do, including parents of autistic children seeking compensation for their children’s autism as being due to “vaccine injury”. Indeed, I long ago discussed how lawyers game VAERS for their litigation, reporting lots of cases of autism as supposedly an “adverse reaction” to vaccines. It’s one reason why those of us who’ve been following the antivaccine movement like to refer to the bad “scientific studies” published by antivaccine physicians and scientists that use VAERS as their data source as “dumpster diving“, for example, this one claiming to find a link between the H1N1 vaccine and miscarriages or one of the earliest examples, Mark and David Geier’s epically bad study trying to link thimerosal-containing vaccines to autism. Meanwhile, in 2006 Jim Laidler infamously reported to VAERS that the flu vaccine had turned him into The Incredible Hulk, and VAERS accepted the report. True, someone did contact him to question it. If Laidler hadn’t been honest, he could have insisted that the report remain, and it would have.

Why would anyone set up a system like VAERS , which is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? First, you must understand that VAERS isn’t intended to give an accurate estimate of the frequency of various adverse events after vaccination. Rather, it was always intended to serve as an early warning system, a “canary in the coalmine”, so to speak. Consequently, even though antivaxxers like to harp on how passive surveillance systems generally capture only a small fraction of adverse reactions, one thing VAERS does do is capture severe reactions. Practically no one is going to report an adverse reaction like a sore arm or transient fever to VAERS , but you know damned well they’ll report more serious ones, such as a seizure. The problem is that the natural human tendency to seek patterns, coupled with the way antivaccine lawyers game VAERS by having their clients report all sorts of spurious “adverse events” to the database after vaccination, means that VAERS is a very noisy, distorted, and unreliable database. Still, it has its place if you understand its intended purpose. That purpose, contrary to what antivaxxers would have you believe, is not as the be-all and end-all of vaccine safety surveillance. It is primarily a hypothesis-generating, not hypothesis-testing, system when it comes to questions related to vaccine safety. To test the correlations found in VAERS requires different systems, systems such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).

Antivaxxers sometimes mention VSD, but often labor under the delusion that it is not an automatic surveillance system. It is:

The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) is a collaborative project between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and eight health care organizations. The VSD started in 1990 and continues today in order to monitor safety of vaccines and conduct studies about rare and serious adverse events following immunization. The VSD uses electronic health data from each participating site. This includes information on vaccines: the kind of vaccine given to each patient, date of vaccination, and other vaccinations given on the same day. The VSD also uses information on medical illnesses that have been diagnosed at doctors’ offices, urgent care visits, emergency department visits, and hospital stays. The VSD conducts vaccine safety studies based on questions or concerns raised from the medical literature and reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ). When there are new vaccines that have been recommended for use in the United States or if there are changes in how a vaccine is recommended, the VSD will monitor the safety of these vaccines.

So VSD is run by the CDC, meaning that it’s not part of this reorganization or shuttering or folding of NVPO into OIDP. Its strengths include being an active surveillance system that contains very granular data, given its tight affiliation with Kaiser Permanente in California, its Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA), which allows it to identify adverse events following vaccination in near real time, and its data sharing and collaboration with other scientists outside of the CDC and the involved health care organizations. As an aside, it was an attempt to merge datasets from the VSD in a manner that would compromise the privacy of patients whose data were in the datasets that got antivaxxers Mark and David Geier into trouble so long ago.

Then, there are two active surveillance systems that cover vaccines. First, there is the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project, in which the CDC partners with several large academic medical centers and Kaiser Permanente Northern California to study vaccine safety:

CISA addresses vaccine safety issues, conducts high quality clinical research, and assesses complex clinical adverse events following vaccination. CISA facilitates CDC’s collaboration with vaccine safety experts at leading academic medical centers and strengthens national capacity for vaccine safety monitoring. The CISA Project provides consultation to US clinicians who have vaccine safety questions about a specific patient residing in the US. In addition, CISA provides consultation to US healthcare providers and public health partners on vaccine safety issues, and reviews clinical adverse events following immunization (AEFI) involving the US-licensed vaccines.

Second, there is FDA’s Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System (PRISM):

The word “prism” might make you think of a triangular piece of glass that separates white light into a rainbow of colors. But at FDA, it means a powerful, computer-based system that separates critical bits of information from vast streams of healthcare data in order to investigate adverse events and determine if there is a connection to a specific vaccine. And while the FDA prism–called Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System (PRISM)—might not have such a colorful name, it’s a bright light in the agency’s continual efforts to identify adverse effects in a timely manner. PRISM is a cooperative effort between FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and its partners in the health care and medical insurance communities. It analyzes health insurance claims data from four national healthcare plans: Aetna, HealthCore (Wellpoint), Humana, and OptumInsight (United Healthcare).

And:

PRISM is one component of FDA’s Sentinel Initiative, which monitors the safety of a variety of FDA-regulated medical products by examining information in electronic healthcare databases. Sentinel performs what is called “active” surveillance, as opposed to “passive” surveillance. Passive FDA surveillance systems depend on industry, consumers, patients, and healthcare professionals to recognize and report suspected adverse events to an FDA web site, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ). This means that FDA might not become aware of potential problems related to a licensed product for months. Unlike passive surveillance, Sentinel’s active surveillance lets FDA initiate its own studies using existing electronic healthcare data in a timely manner. Sentinel also lets FDA evaluate safety issues in targeted groups, such as children, or to evaluate specific conditions (e.g., heart attacks) that are not usually reported as possible adverse events of medical products through passive reporting systems.

In summary, VSD uses real medical records, while PRISM and CISA are active surveillance systems. Contrary to what antivaxxers claim, there are at least four systems to monitor vaccine safety, two of which are active surveillance systems. Unfortunately, PRISM is no longer being used to its potential, as Zimmer reports.

What does the transfer of NVPO to OIDP mean?

Reading Zimmer’s article profoundly depressed me, because it just demonstrated to me yet again how little this administration cares for science. In particular, Zimmer mentioned the effective use of PRISM as a potential casualty of the transfer of NVPO to OIDP. First, Zimmer describes how PRISM came about:

In 1990, the C.D.C. set up a new way to track vaccines that didn’t depend on people coming forward. The agency worked with health care organizations to get updates on people’s medical conditions. That system now covers 12 million people. Researchers can use it to look for clusters of symptoms that arise in people who get the same vaccine. When the H1N1 flu hit in 2009, Dr. Salmon recognized that these methods didn’t track enough people to quickly pick up rare symptoms. He reached out to researchers at Harvard to build a new system, which came to be known as PRISM. Ten states supplied vaccination records, and five health insurance companies shared anonymous information about 38 million members. PRISM then connected the two databases to track insurance claims in the wake of vaccination. “That really gave us a ton of data,” Dr. Salmon said. The researchers could come up with a background rate of a host of medical conditions. If the H1N1 vaccine was linked to cases that matched the background rate, they could dismiss the symptoms as ordinary. Only if they rose above the background rate would they be considered unusual and warrant a closer look.

As Zimmer notes, the vast majority of reports turned out not to be correlated with vaccines, citing the example of some vaccinated people developing Bell’s palsy and how researchers were able to exclude vaccines as a cause within two weeks using PRISM. Now, for reasons that are unclear, PRISM appears to be no longer used to look for rare vaccine adverse events, the FDA using it only to monitor drug safety now:

The other systems can provide safety information much faster, but they’re small compared with the PRISM system, which now covers about 60 million people. The F.D.A. still uses PRISM for drug safety research, but not for vaccines. Dr. Salmon is baffled that the agency hasn’t tapped into it again. “Why would you not use that?” he asked. (An agency spokeswoman said it might use PRISM in the future should the need arise.)

Worse, though, is that there now appears to be a lack of coordination once provided by NVPO now that it has been folded into OIDP:

But Dr. Nicole Lurie, who was assistant secretary for preparedness and response at H.H.S. during the 2009 pandemic, said the loss of the vaccine safety office was especially costly once the coronavirus pandemic hit. “The coordinated leadership for stuff like this would likely come from the National Vaccine Program Office,” she said. Dr. Lurie, now an adviser at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, has been waiting along with other researchers, month after month, for coordinated leadership to emerge from the federal government on long-term vaccine safety. “There are a whole bunch of people who were really concerned about this,” she said. An F.D.A. official who declined to be identified said that in the absence of the National Vaccine Program Office, F.D.A. and C.D.C. staff members were relying on relationships they had built across the agencies, meeting regularly to discuss their separate projects. That leaderless effort concerns Dr. Lurie. “There’s no sort of active coordination to bring all the information together,” she said.

Given the track record of the Trump administration, I fear that scientists intensely interested in vaccine safety will have to wait a long time for coordinated leadership. If there’s one thing that is clear about this administration, even among those who support it, it’s that coordinated leadership really isn’t something it’s particularly good at.

Meanwhile, on Thursday an expert from the CDC and one from the FDA gave presentations about monitoring systems at the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, describing one that will use smartphone apps to monitor health care workers and other essential workers after vaccination, with another looking at a database of insurance claims and electronic health records, with a third looking at data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid data to track people over 65 for adverse events after vaccination. None of these are as comprehensive as PRISM.

From my perspective, it’s hard for me to tell how much of this latest development in which the role of a key office for vaccine safety monitoring has apparently been much diminished in a “reorganization” (or whatever you want to call it) is due to incompetence or the hyperpoliticization of agencies that were intended to be apolitical. Could administration spokespeople claiming that NVPO is just as relevant and active as ever be correct? Who knows? I suppose it’s possible, but the statements of so many public health experts expressing alarm definitely give me pause.

Here’s what worries me, regardless of who wins the election. By the time COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out and distributed next year (at the earliest), the HHS, CDC, and FDA will have been “reorganized” and stripped of so much expertise through a brain drain resulting from the demoralization caused by so much incompetence and political interference that it will be very difficult for the CDC and FDA to monitor the safety of the new vaccines effectively. Even if Joe Biden wins, he can’t do anything before January 20, 2021, and it will take many months, if not several years to reverse the damage. As hard as it is to believe now, one day the pandemic will end. After that (no, even now) we have to worry about all the other routine vaccines, in particular how much confidence in vaccines will have eroded due to a distrust of the COVID-19 vaccine, the general incompetence and hostility to regulation of the current administration, and the unholy union of COVID-19 deniers, antivaxxers, and QAnon conspiracy theorists.



Stable Genius Goes Golfing, Misses G20 Covid MeetingAfter briefly attending the virtual G20 summit from the White House's Situation Room on Saturday, President Doanld Trump skipped a meeting with other leaders of the world's 20 largest economies where the attendees discussed the coronavirus pandemic.

The "Pandemic Preparedness and Response" meeting included addresses by French President Emanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but no American government officials were listed as speakers. Both Macron and Merkel have been leaders in the global call for a coordinated international response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the French leader calling on Saturday for "solidarity" between countries.

As the U.S. allies prepared to discuss the financing of vaccine collaborations at the two-day G20 summit, Trump retreated to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia.

In the U.S., Covid-19 cases passed 12 million cases on Saturday, less than a week after reaching 11 million cases. On Friday, the country set a new record for new cases recorded in a single day, with more than 198,500 cases confirmed. Deaths are now higher than average in all 50 states and are peaking in 14 states including Maine, Wisconsin, and North Dakota.

Governors, including Trump's Republican allies such as Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, are attempting to undo the damage done by the president'sand his political party's widespread dismissal of public health guidance like mask-wearing and social distancing. Earlier this week, Reynolds pleaded with Iowans to obey a new mask mandate, which she issued after months of calling such measures "feel-good" restrictions.

"If Iowans don't buy into this, we lose," Reynolds said this week. "The cost in human life will be high."

Despite reports of overwhelmed hospitals in states including Texas, Kansas, Tennessee, and Nevada, the president has taken no questions from reporters about the pandemic since most news outlets declared President-elect Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 election on November 7.

Instead, the president has been largely focused on his efforts to prove the election, which Biden won by more than six million votes, was rigged and that so-called "voter fraud" is behind Biden's victory. On Saturday, after leaving the G20 summit and before arriving at his golf club, Trump tweeted about unspecified "big voter fraud information coming out concerning Georgia," which certified the election results on Friday after a hand recount confirmed that Biden won the state.

"The president is not only missing from his post, but he's encouraging a mutiny," Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, told The Guardian on Saturday. "There's no precedent in American history for this kind of deranged behavior."

Chinese-developed COVID19 vaccine CoronaVac has made progress in its late-stage clinical trials in Turkey as there have been 1,111vaccinations in 638 volunteers - all healthcare workers - across local 25 medical centers as of November 16, the trials study coordinator Professor Murat Akova of the Infectious Diseases department at Hacettepe University, where the clinical tests were launched on September 17, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Turkey's research team confirmed the safety of Chinese-developed vaccine after the clinical trials on the CoronaVac were temporarily suspended in Brazil on Monday due to a supposed "adverse event" which later proved to be a suicide case unrelated to the vaccine.Some 150 volunteers - unknown if they got vaccine or placebo - underwent 331 adverse reactions, but none of these adverse reactions were severe, said Akova, saying that 8.49 percent of main reactions were local reactions (e.g. pain at the injection site) and 11.58 percent of systemic reactions included fever, headache, and tiredness.Akova told the Global Times that the vaccine candidate is safe without unexpected side effects so far based on their observations but they are not yet convinced about its efficacy."The main advantage at this stage [of CoronaVac] is related with logistics; i.e. it can be kept in fridge at 4 C as opposed to -70 C for Pfizer vaccine," said Akova.The Turkish team informed the Ethics Committee and suspended the trials upon hearing about the temporary suspension of trials in Brazil, but resumed soon after learning about the death of the participant was not related with the vaccination."For efficacy analysis (i.e. whether the vaccine is effective to prevent COVID-19), we have to identify 40 volunteers developing COVID-19 [from all participants who have been taking doses]. Then, the independent safety board will look at the data and see whether these patients had vaccine or placebo, in order to calculate vaccine production rate," said Professor Akova.The local department requested the vaccine candidate to be at least 60 percent efficient as protocol set. The trials research team and its Ethics Committee decided to make an interim analysis when they found 20 COVID-19 patents among the volunteers. They have now found out five volunteers developed COVID-19 after 14 days of the second dose (i.e. 28 days after the first vaccine), according to the research team.The clinical researchers now have exceeded 600 volunteers and they plan to extend their volunteers pool to the general public. And the team would take 2:1 randomization, which means giving a real vaccine for every two volunteers and a placebo for another volunteer. "In that way, more people will have the chance of having a real vaccine. Then we shall wait to see 20-40 patients with COVID-19 developing among the vaccines."They largely rely on data from Brazil, China and Indonesia to help enhance their analysis. The team expects to reach their interim analysis by January 2021.

Steroid treatment should be reserved for sickest Covid19 patients, suggest US scientists - Northeast NowScientists from the United States (US) have suggested that steroids such as dexamethasone should be used for the treatment of only the sickest Covid19 patients.

The researchers, mostly from Washington University School of Medicine and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, made an analysis of the levels of the immune system protein cytokines, and other health markers in 168 adults with Covid19, 26 adults with flu and 16 healthy volunteers.

According to the research, published in the journal Science Advances, fewer than 5% of the Covis19 patients, including some of the sickest individuals, had the life-threatening, hyperinflammatory immune response, known as the cytokine storm syndrome.

The researchers explained that cytokine storms develop when excess or abnormally regulated levels of cytokine proteins in the body lead to hyperinflammation and tissue damage.

They also claimed that most adults with moderate-to-severe Covid19 have a suppressed immune response against the novel coronavirus rather than life-threatening hyper-inflammation

While dexamethasone and other steroids are prescribed to treat cytokine storms, they said these drugs can backfire in patients whose immune response is already suppressed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been more than 53.7 million confirmed Covid19 cases in total since the start of the pandemic, while over 1.3 million people have lost their lives due to the infection.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday warned that there was “a long way to go” in getting the virus under control, globally.

“There is no doubt that a vaccine will be a vital tool for controlling the pandemic, and we’re encouraged by the preliminary results of clinical trials released this week. Never in history has vaccine research progressed so quickly. We must apply the same urgency and innovation to ensuring that all countries benefit from this scientific achievement,” Tedros said.

“But we have a long way to go. The world cannot put all its eggs in one basket, and neglect the many other tools at our disposal,” he added.Steroid treatment should be reserved for sickest Covid19 patients, suggest US scientists - Northeast NowScientists from the United States (US) have suggested that steroids such as dexamethasone should be used for the treatment of only the sickest Covid19 patients.

HiFiBiO Therapeutics Inks Partnership with Pharmsynthez and IBCh for the Clinical Development and Commercialization of its SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody in RussiaCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #COVID19--HiFiBiO Therapeutics forms partnership with Pharmsynthez and IBCh for the clinical development and commercialization of HFB30132A in RussiaCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HiFiBiO Therapeutics, a multinational biotherapeutics company with unique expertise in immune modulation and single cell science, today announced a partnership with Russian pharmaceutical company, Pharmsynthez PJSC (MOEX: LIFE), and Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry RAS (IBCh). The partnership aims to advance HFB30132A, a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody for the treatment of COVID-19, through clinical development and commercial sale in Russia, pending approval from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. An IND has been submitted to the Ministry of Health and clinical sites have been selected for a Phase I/II study. Per the agreement, Pharmsynthez will purchase HFB30132A for clinical trials in Russia. Upon regulatory approval, Pharmsynthez will continue to commercialize the product as the exclusive partner of HiFiBiO Therapeutics in Russia. HiFiBiO Therapeutics retains all rights and continues to develop and commercialize HFB30132A globally.

HiFiBiO has leveraged its expertise in immune modulation and single-cell science to rapidly discover, engineer, and develop HFB30132A in less than six months. Additionally, the company is currently dosing the second cohort of healthy volunteers in a Phase I ascending dose study (NCT04590430) to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of HFB30132A. This Phase I study will be followed by global phase II/III clinical trials in high-risk adults with asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19.

“We are excited to partner with Pharmsynthez and leverage its expertise and resources to successfully develop and deliver this innovative therapy to patients in Russia,” said Jeff He, Chief Operating Officer of HiFiBiO Therapeutics. “This strategic partnership showcases our open innovation approach and the global collaboration required to rapidly address this pandemic.”

"We expect that HFB30132A will be able to provide a reliable level of protection for people infected with the virus, especially for those who have risk factors such as cardiovascular disease or weakened immunity,” said Kirill Mayorov, President of Pharmsynthez. “This antibody has the potential to help fight active infections and prevent a cascade of serious complications that we have seen around the world.

About HFB30132A

HFB30132A is an anti-SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antibody engineered with specific sequences identified from the B cells of a COVID-19 convalescent patient. The antibody binds the viral Spike protein with high affinity and has demonstrated potent neutralization of live virus infection in vitro and in vivo. The antibody extensively covers the interface between Spike protein and its receptor ACE2, and also efficiently neutralizes a panel of mutated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus strains, including the well-described mutant D614G. HFB30132A is expected to work as a monotherapy, both to provide immediate defense against an active infection and to proactively prevent one. Compared to conventional therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, HFB30132A is engineered to have an extended half-life and reduced Fc receptor functions that are expected to result in longer protection, fewer potential adverse events, and higher distribution to lung and mucosal tissue.

Covid-19: How a 'warm vaccine' could help India tackle coronavirusA vaccine that can withstand high temperatures could be a game changer in hot countries.India immunisation programmes is one of the largest in the world

In India's boiling summers, temperatures can easily rise to 50C (122F).

Nearly all vaccines need to be transported and distributed between 2C and 8C in what comprises the so-called cold chain. And most of the Covid-19 vaccines under development, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), will need to be refrigerated at temperatures well below 0C, the freezing point of water.

Imagine a Covid-19 vaccine that is heat tolerant and can be transported to remote towns and villages for tens of millions of jabs without depending on the cold chain.

A group of Indian scientists are working on such a vaccine. The "warm" or a heat-stable vaccine, they claim, can be stored at 100C for 90 minutes, at 70C for about 16 hours, and at 37C for more than a month and more.

Raghavan Varadarajan, a biophysicist and professor at the Indian Institute of Science, and his team have tested this vaccine on animals. "We got good results," Prof Varadarajan told me. Now they are waiting for funding to begin safety and toxicity tests on humans. Their paper has been accepted for publication in Journal of Biological Chemistry, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, published by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

"I am hopeful that after this study, newer avenues would open up with regards to having cold-chain independent vaccines," said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology.

The oral cholera vaccine is one of the three thermo stable vaccines

Vaccines that can withstand high temperatures are rare.

Only three - offering protection against meningitis, human papillomavirus (HPV) and cholera - are licensed and approved by WHO for use at temperatures up to 40C. These vaccines can be deployed quickly in hard- to-reach communities, and reduce pressures on healthcare workers. They have proved to be useful during large-scale emergency responses like distributing oral cholera vaccine in Mozambique last year following Cyclone Idai, according to WHO.

Story continues

"The possibility to transport vaccines outside the cold chain for the very last mile to reach the most remote populations in resource-limited settings is very helpful. It can be particularly helpful for mass vaccination campaigns when hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses need to be transported to several vaccination points within a short period of time," said Julien Potet, policy adviser (vaccines) of Médecins Sans Frontières' Access Campaign.

India expects to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and plans to inoculate some 250 million people between January and July next year. They will be mainly distributed through the country's 42-year-old immunisation programme, one of the world's largest health programmes. It targets 55 million people, mainly newborns and pregnant women, with 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year.

How the vaccine cold chain works: 1. Vaccines shipped to destination country 2. Refrigerated lorry to cold room 3. Distribution in portable ice boxes to regional centres 4. Stored in electric fridges between 2C and 8C 5. Carried in portable ice boxes to local venues for vaccination campaign

To service this massive programme, India already has a robust network of state-owned cold storages for vaccines that can provide doses to more than eight million locations.

Storing and keeping vaccines cool requires walk in freezers, ice-lined refrigerators, refrigerated trucks, coolant packs such as dry ice and cold boxes, which help in last-mile delivery. Nearly four million doctors and nurses are involved in the immunisation campaign.

"India has largely managed vaccines and immunisation drives well," says B Thiagarajan, managing director of Blue Star, which has a major share of pharmaceutical cold chain products. "When it comes to vaccines which have to be stored at temperatures between 2 to 8C, we are well equipped. If the vaccine has to be kept at -40C, there will be a problem."

The WHO says Covid-19 vaccines under development can be categorised in three storage temperature requirements: 2-8C, -20C and -70C. A number of candidates, say experts, will require an "ultra cold chain" at temperatures which will "definitely prove a challenge to many countries."

Covid19 vaccine

Ensuring a consistent cold chain for a mass immunisation programme will be a big challenge.

At nearly 40 million tonnes, India's cold storage capacity is one of the world's largest, but it mainly stores fresh food, healthcare products, flowers and chemicals. Much of the capacity is not internationally hygiene compliant for storing vaccines. Vaccines can easily lose potency when exposed to higher temperatures, and have to be protected against accidental freezing during transport, as well as breaks in the cold chain due to exposure to high heat.

Even if the vaccine could be stored at 2C to 8C, the storage capacity in most cold chains has been designed to enable immunisation of mainly infants. This capacity, according to WHO, "risks being vastly insufficient as we try to rapidly vaccinate the entire population for Covid-19".

"There are significant challenges and they can be overcome," says Andrea Taylor of the US-based Duke Global Health Institute. "But without knowing if they will have access to vaccines or the number of doses or type of cold storage needed for vaccines they may get, it is difficult for countries to move aggressively to prepare".

That is where a "warm vaccine" could truly be a game changer.

Bhubaneswar: Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday said people above sixty years and pregnant women will get priority in Covid-19 vaccine distribution along with health workers in the state.

He announced this while taking a review meeting on Covid-19 situation in the state.

During this meeting, it was decided that once the vaccine is available, it will be provided to senior citizens, pregnant women and health workers on priority.

The database of people with comorbidities and suffering from serious ailments will be helpful during the vaccination.

Notably, the state government has already commenced the process for the preparation of a comprehensive database of frontline workers including the health, Anganwadi and ASHA workers for seamless initiation of the vaccination programme.

Maintaining that the people need to be careful during the winter season in view of possible second Covid-19 wave, the Chief Minister requested them to follow the Covid-19 guidelines including the use of mask and social distancing.

Meanwhile, another 1303 Covid-19 patients have recovered in the state. The total recovered cases now stand at 3,01,777.

"Odisha has crossed yet another milestone in the fight against #COVID19 pandemic with more than 3 lakh recoveries. Salute to our healthcare professionals and #CovidWarriors who are making huge sacrifices and working with utmost dedication to save precious lives," tweeted the Chief Minister.

AstraZeneca and Oxford University Say Their Vaccine Is ‘Highly Effective’The coronavirus vaccine candidate was up to 90 percent effective, said the drugmaker, which became the third this month to report promising results. At the same time, the virus is spreading out of control across the U.S., sending a record number of people hos…The Virus Surge, Once Centered in the Midwest, Is Accelerating in 45 U.S. States AstraZeneca said its vaccine candidate was up to 90 percent effective, suggesting that the world could eventually have at least three working vaccines. At the same time, the virus is accelerating across the U.S., and officials are imposing new restrictions to flatten the curve. This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s not just the Midwest: The U.S. outbreak is accelerating all over the map. A drive-through testing site in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times When infections began rising sharply in the U.S. in September, the growth was driven largely by outbreaks in the Upper Midwest. States like North Dakota and Wisconsin soon became the hardest hit in the nation, relative to their size, and the region continues to struggle. Now, though, with the whole country’s daily average of new cases is as high as it has ever been — over 171,000 — the most rapid growth is happening elsewhere. Nine states are reporting more than twice as many new cases a day as they did two weeks ago, and none of them are in the Midwest. The surges in those states — Arizona, California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Vermont — reflect a still-escalating national crisis. Officials warn that it will only get worse if people disregard warnings about travel and get-togethers for the approaching holidays. “Let me be very clear: A Thanksgiving gathering this year may very well lead to a funeral,” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, whose state is home to five of the 10 metropolitan areas in the country where new case reports are rising the fastest. “The virus is at large,” the governor said. “Know the risks and respect them.” Forty-five states are seeing sustained increases, and 17 states added more cases in the seven-day period that ended Sunday than in any other week of the pandemic. Major metropolitan areas that are reporting new cases at or near record levels are all across the continent: Pittsburgh. Albuquerque. Baltimore. San Diego. Some that have been bad for a while, like El Paso, are coping with the flood of hospitalizations that generally follow a couple of weeks behind a rising tide of new cases. A major hospital group in Arizona, Banner Health, began banning most visitors from its facilities Sunday night because of the worsening spread of the virus.



And where the hospitals come under intense strain, officials are turning, however reluctantly, to impose or reimpose restrictions in the hope of flattening the curve. In Los Angeles County, Calif., which has been averaging more than 3,500 cases a day lately, officials said on Sunday that barring indoor restaurant dining was no longer sufficient, and that outdoor dining would have to shut down as well. “Unfortunately, if our cases and hospitalizations continue to increase, we will need to issue further restrictions to protect our health care system and prevent more deaths,” said Barbara Ferrer, the county public health director. —

AstraZeneca becomes the third major vaccine developer to announce promising results. A volunteer in Oxford, England, last week received the vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times The drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that an early analysis of some of its late-stage clinical trials, conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, showed that its coronavirus vaccine was 70.4 percent effective in preventing Covid-19, suggesting that the world could eventually have at least three working vaccines — and more supply — to help curb the pandemic. The British-Swedish company, which has been developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the third major vaccine developer this month to announce encouraging early results, following Pfizer and Moderna, which both said that their vaccines were about 95 percent effective in late-stage studies. AstraZeneca’s results are a reassuring sign of the safety of the vaccine. It came under global scrutiny after AstraZeneca temporarily paused its trials in September to investigate potential safety issues after a participant in Britain developed a neurological illness. Oxford and AstraZeneca said they would submit their data to regulators in Britain, Europe and Brazil and seek emergency authorization. The company said its early analysis was based on 131 coronavirus cases. The trials used two different dosing regimens, one of which was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 and the other of which was 62 percent effective. The regimen that was 90 percent effective involved using a halved first dose and a standard second dose. Oxford and AstraZeneca also said that there were no hospitalized or severe cases of the coronavirus in anyone who received the vaccine, and that they had seen a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine could reduce transmission. AstraZeneca’s vaccine is expected to come with relatively simple storage requirements, which would be an asset once it gets rolled out. The company has said it anticipates the vaccine will require refrigeration, though it has not provided details about how long and at what temperature it can be kept. Moderna’s vaccine can be kept for up to a month at the temperature of an ordinary refrigerator. Pfizer’s can be kept for up to 5 days in conventional refrigerators, or in special coolers for up to 15 days, but otherwise needs ultracold storage. AstraZeneca has said it aims to bring data from its studies of its vaccine being conducted overseas to the Food and Drug Administration — which would mean that the agency will likely review and authorize a vaccine before late-stage data are ready on how well the vaccine works in American participants. British regulators already have been conducting a so-called rolling review of the vaccine. “Today marks an important milestone in our fight against the pandemic,” AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said. “This vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against Covid-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency.” Professor Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said that “these findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives.” AstraZeneca’s results could significantly strengthen the global effort to produce enough vaccine to create population immunity: The price of the shot, at $3 to $4, is a fraction of that of some other potential vaccines, and AstraZeneca has pledged to make it available at cost around the world until at least July 2021 and in poorer countries in perpetuity. — Rebecca Robbins, Benjamin Mueller and

Cuomo announces new restrictions in Upper Manhattan, Staten Island and other hot spots. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:43 - 0:00 transcript Cuomo Announces New Virus Restrictions Ahead of Thanksgiving Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. We are now coming into the high social season — Thanksgiving, Christmas. It’s the high social season, social activity goes way up in this season. That is a bad combination. Just factor out the current rate of increase. You know, where we are in three weeks? Six thousand cases. That’s before we go into 37 days of the highest socialization period of the year. Yellow Zone in New York City is 2.5, reduces house of worship gatherings. Orange Zone reduces mass gatherings, more businesses close; high risk in an Orange Zone, schools close to clean and test, and then can reopen if they test and the positivity rate is low. New York City, Upper Manhattan is going to become a Yellow Zone. Basically, the Washington Heights area is 3.3. Staten Island, part is a Yellow Zone, part is an Orange Zone. Staten Island is a problem. The number of hospitalizations in Staten Island have gone — over the last three weeks — they basically tripled 33 to 91. It’s a consequence of action. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. Credit Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times As Thanksgiving approaches, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Monday announced new restrictions in parts of the state where virus cases are rising, including New York City, and issued a grim warning that the state was on track for a further resurgence of the virus. The new restrictions included a zone in Upper Manhattan, the first time the state has rolled back reopening in the borough under its program of targeting so-called microclusters. “These are dangerous times that we’re in,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in New York City. Over the last three weeks, the number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state has more than doubled, to 2,724 on Monday from 1,227 on Nov. 2. The number is a far cry from the peak of the pandemic in the spring, when more than 18,000 people were hospitalized. But Mr. Cuomo warned that if current patterns held, the state would hit 6,000 hospitalizations in another three weeks. The increase could become steeper, he said, if people continued gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas in the coming weeks, which he called “37 days of the highest socialization of the year.” The governor again warned residents not to travel for the holidays. The state has currently imposed a 10-person limit on private gatherings in hopes of limiting small parties that he has said have contributed to the resurgence of the virus in the state this fall. Parts of Upper Manhattan, including Washington Heights, will now be a yellow zone under the state’s tiered, color-coded restriction system. Gatherings will be limited to 25 people, with houses of worship limited to 50 percent capacity. Restaurants can serve only up to 4 people at a table. Mr. Cuomo also announced an orange zone, the second level of limits, in southern parts of Staten Island. In those areas, indoor dining will close, as will some nonessential businesses deemed to be high risk, such as gyms and personal-care services. All gatherings will be limited to 10 people, with houses of worship limited to 33 percent capacity and 25 people maximum. Other parts of the borough will become a yellow zone. “Staten Island is a problem,” Mr. Cuomo said. The borough has been a hot spot for the virus in the city in recent months. Mr. Cuomo said that hospitalizations there had increased enough that Staten Island was facing a capacity issue. As a result, the state will open an emergency coronavirus patient facility in the South Beach neighborhood, a move reminiscent of field hospitals set up in the spring, when New York City was one of the hardest hit places in the country. The state also announced new yellow zones in parts of Long Island, including Great Neck, Riverhead and Hampton Bays, and expanded yellow and orange zones upstate, around the cities of Rochester and Syracuse. —

Boris Johnson will lift restrictions on many businesses in England beginning next week. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript England Will Lift Coronavirus Restrictions The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. The national restrictions in England will end on the 2nd of December, and they will not be renewed. From next Wednesday, people will be able to leave their home for any purpose, and meet others in outdoor public spaces subject to the Rule of 6. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen. But without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a winter or new-year surge. The incidence of the disease is, alas, still widespread in many areas. So we’re not going to replace national measures with a free for all — the status quo ante-Covid — we’re going to go back instead to a regional tiered approach, applying the toughest measures where Covid is most prevalent. I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year. But in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. We all want some kind of Christmas. We need it. We certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. Credit Credit... Tolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Gyms, stores and hair salons will be allowed to reopen in England next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday, telling lawmakers that for the first time since the spread of the coronavirus the country could “see a route out of the pandemic.” Speaking to Parliament by video link, Mr. Johnson said that he would lift a national lockdown on Dec. 2, as expected, and that England would then return to a regionalized system of restrictions based on three tiers of controls. However, the new plan will keep substantial restrictions on pubs and restaurants — a move that risks friction with some of Mr. Johnson’s own lawmakers, who fear that the hospitality trade will be hit hard by the limitations. Crucially, the government has not yet announced which parts of the country will be subjected to which set of restrictions, though that information is expected later this week. Mr. Johnson, who has been quarantining since last week after being exposed to a member of Parliament who tested positive, hailed the progress announced by the team at Oxford University developing a vaccine with the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, adding that the “scientific cavalry is in sight.” There have been at least 1.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to Public Health England. As of Monday morning, 55,024 people had died. United Kingdom Covid Map and Case Count A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. Under the plan to ease restrictions, gyms, stores and hair salons will reopen and collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports will be allowed to resume in all parts of England. But in the worst-affected parts of the country, pubs and restaurants will stay closed except for takeout service. In some other areas, people will only be able to drink in pubs if they are also eating a meal. Those pubs will, however, be allowed to stay open until 11 p.m., an hour later than had been allowed immediately before the lockdown began, though the bars will have to take last orders for alcohol at 10 p.m. Some spectators will be allowed into sports events, though even in the least-affected parts of England, crowds will be limited to a maximum of 4,000, and in some parts of the country none will be allowed. The package outlined by Mr. Johnson reflected his desire to prevent another surge in virus cases while seeking not to antagonize his backbench lawmakers, who have threatened to rebel over lockdown measures. —

The governor of California is in quarantine with his family after a possible exposure. Dr. Haleh Farzanmehr administered a coronavirus test to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California last month at a testing facility in Valencia, Calif. Credit... Pool photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has gone into quarantine, along with his family, after three of the governor’s children were exposed to a state highway patrol officer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s whole family — Mr. Newsom; his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom; and their four children — tested negative for the virus on Sunday, but will stay apart from other people for two weeks anyway, in compliance with state guidelines, his office said. “We are grateful for all the officers that keep our family safe and for every frontline worker who continues to go to work during this pandemic,” the governor said on Twitter. The Newsoms learned of the exposure on Friday evening, the governor’s office said. The whole family waited until Sunday to be tested in order to reduce the likelihood of a false negative result (it can take time for the virus to build up to detectable levels after infection). The governor and his partner did not come in direct contact with the officer. One of the Newsom children was already in quarantine after a classmate tested positive, Politico reported on Friday. The governor has come under fire for sending his children back to their private school classrooms while many public schools in the state remained closed and most families had to adapt to at-home learning. Mr. Newsom has also faced outrage over his recent decision to attend a birthday dinner at a restaurant in Napa Valley with members of several other households. With infections and hospitalizations each rising at an alarming rate in the state, officials announced a curfew last week, and some counties and the state have reimposed sweeping restrictions they had been gradually lifting. According to a New York Times database, the state has reported an average of 11,802 new cases a day over the last week, a sharp increase from a month ago. The figure exceeds the state’s earlier peak of just over 10,000 new cases a day in late July. The curfew bars nearly all Californians from being away from their homes from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for essential purposes, and is scheduled to last through Dec. 21. In Los Angeles County, where indoor dining has been shuttered for months and virus cases are still surging, health officials took the additional step on Sunday of closing down outdoor dining “to reduce the possibility for crowding and the potential for exposure.” That order takes effect on Wednesday, just before Thanksgiving. —

A C.D.C. advisory group discussed which Americans should get vaccines first. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the C.D.C. indicated in a meeting on Monday that health care workers should be the first recipients of coronavirus vaccines. Credit... Go Nakamura/Getty Images An expert committee charged with deciding which Americans should be first in line for a coronavirus vaccine met on Monday afternoon to discuss a number of questions before it votes — likely by mid-December — on final recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After the group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, delivers its recommendations, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, will quickly decide whether to approve them. That will be the final step, after a review by the Food and Drug Administration and its own advisory committee on vaccines, before the first doses of vaccine are shipped nationwide. A subgroup of the committee had already suggested that health care workers, who total about 21 million, should be the first to be vaccinated. On Monday, it recommended also including residents of long-term care facilities in that initial group. Next would be essential workers, then adults with high-risk medical conditions and those who are 65 or older. Some of the questions the committee considered Monday included: Whether people who have already had Covid-19 should not be vaccinated until there is ample supply. Dr. Robert Atmar, a committee member and infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that “at the beginning, where it’s a resource-limited vaccine, my opinion is that we need to try and target as best we can to those that we know are susceptible.” But another committee member, Dr. Grace Lee, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, pushed back, saying that much remains unknown about long-term immunity.

Whether essential workers like police, firefighters, teachers and transportation workers should be the second group to get the vaccine. “To me, the issue of ethics is very significant, very important for this country and clearly favors the essential worker group,” said Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles, noting that the group included a “high proportion of minority, low-income and low-education workers.” —

A new analysis shows how political divisions impacted attitudes toward restrictions. Demonstrators protested ‘Stay Home, Stay Healthy’ orders in Washington State in April. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic last spring quickly became politicized, forcing officials and citizens around the world to choose between public health and personal freedom. In the United States, the tension broke down roughly along ideological lines, with many blue states taking containment measures seriously, and red states less so. In a new analysis, a team of researchers provided some of the first hard evidence of how the political divide drove behavior. The paper, posted Monday by the journal Nature Human Behavior, found that one measure of partisan hostility — the intensity of distrust and animosity toward the other side, red or blue — correlated both with people’s attitudes toward containment policies, and how they behaved. The findings were based on interviews with more than 2,400 adults, conducted once in the summer of 2019 and again in April of this year. The research team, led by James Druckman, a political scientist at Northwestern University, found that the average Democrat “is more worried, is more likely to have changed behaviors and is more supportive of policies to stop the spread of infections than the average Republican,” although there were substantial overlaps in attitudes. The research team, which included scientists from the University of Arizona, Stony Brook University and the University of Pennsylvania, determined that in the hardest hit areas, these differences shrank. In effect, concern for personal and family safety blunted the effect of partisanship, as most everyone responded to the local outbreak. “These findings have implications for understanding how best to combat COVID-19,” the authors concluded. Since partisan hostility underlies partisan gaps, “policymakers will need to devise different strategies to bring the parties together on these issues.” —

More than one million travelers were screened at airports on Sunday, a new high in the pandemic. Travelers at Miami International Airport on Sunday. Experts have been strongly discouraging holiday travel. Credit... David Santiago/Miami Herald, via Associated Press More travelers were screened at airport security checkpoints on Sunday than on any day since the pandemic took hold in March, a worrying sign that people flying to visit their families for Thanksgiving could increase the spread of the coronavirus. A little more than one million people were screened by the Transportation Security Administration on Sunday, according to federal data published on Monday. That number is about half of what it was in 2019, but it represents a big increase from the spring, when less than a half a million people flew on any given day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, have been strongly discouraging holiday travel for fear that it would increase the number of new infections, which have surged in recent weeks as the weather turns colder and more people spend time indoors. Airlines have said that flying is safe because of the precautions the industry has put in place, like high-end air filtration. They also point to the relatively few published cases of the coronavirus being spread during a flight. But the science on in-flight safety is far from settled, and travelers would still be at risk of contracting or spreading the virus at airports and once they are at their destination. The increase in travel during the holidays has been encouraging for airlines. But it won’t be enough to offset the deep losses they have suffered during the pandemic. The nation’s largest airlines have collectively reported tens of billions of dollars in losses so far this year, and analysts expect demand to remain weak for a couple of years or more. The industry is hoping that the incoming Biden administration and Congress will give airlines more aid early next year.

Adoptee reunions were disrupted by the pandemic. Some still found a way. Mallory Guy, right, used a translation app to communicate with her birth mother, Lim Mi-Soon. Credit... Jun Michael Park for The New York Times When a taxi deposited Mallory Guy in front of an apartment building in Cheonan, South Korea, after a 14-hour flight from Atlanta, a Korean couple was waiting for her with open arms. It was the first time since she was 7 months old that Ms. Guy, 33, had been in the country where she was born. It was also her first time seeing her birth parents since she was sent to the United States more than three decades ago. For some adoptees, birth family reunions had become a rite of passage. Then came the pandemic. The pilgrimages back to South Korea dwindled. Many adoptees canceled long-planned reunions after the government’s quarantine rules for foreign visitors made the trips too costly and time-consuming. When Ms. Guy arrived in South Korea in September, she did not know whether she would be allowed to spend the two weeks at her biological parents’ home or be forced to stay at a costly government hotel. The South Korean Embassy’s website said only that such decisions were made on a case-by-case basis. Her parents made Korean food for her and American snacks like peanut butter and jelly. (They also stocked up on milk, because they had heard that Americans love milk.) They even bought her an exercise bike, because she had told them during calls that she enjoyed using her Peloton. After two weeks of immersion in her parents’ home, Ms. Guy took a coronavirus test, as mandated by the government, so she could leave quarantine and explore her home country with her family. When a testing administrator asked her when she had last left the country for the United States, “I told her 1987, and she looked super-confused.” The worker asked again, and Ms. Guy confirmed that she understood the question. After telling her 1987 four more times, Ms. Guy said, “she finally wrote it down.” —

Tami Chappell/EPA, via Shutterstock Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, a Republican who is campaigning in a high-stakes runoff election that could determine control of the Senate, plans to get “back out on the campaign trail” after receiving her second consecutive negative coronavirus test, a campaign spokesman said on Monday. This comes after Ms. Loeffler’s campaign on Sunday said she was isolating “out of an abundance of caution” after a series of coronavirus tests delivered mixed messages about whether she had contracted the disease. According to Stephen Lawson, a campaign spokesman, a rapid test Ms. Loeffler took Friday morning came back negative, but a second test she also took that morning — a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test, which is considered more accurate — returned a positive result on Friday evening. In between her receipt of the two conflicting test results, Ms. Loeffler attended campaign-related events on Friday, including a rally with Vice President Mike Pence and Senator David Perdue of Georgia, Mr. Lawson said. Ms. Loeffler, 49, received another P.C.R. test on Saturday morning. But it was “inconclusive,” Mr. Lawson said of the results, which came in Saturday evening. On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lawson issued another statement saying that the senator’s “previously inconclusive P.C.R. results were retested overnight and the results thankfully came back negative.” The negative result on Monday was also from a P.C.R. test. He added: “Out of an abundance of caution, she will continue to self-isolate and be retested again to hopefully receive consecutive negative test results. We will share those results as they are made available. She will continue to confer with medical experts and follow C.D.C. guidelines.” Ms. Loeffler notified those with whom she had sustained contact while she awaits further test results, he said. Ms. Loeffler has held recent events with prominent Republicans, including Mr. Pence, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mr. Perdue, who is also engaged in a runoff election that could determine control of the Senate. On Sunday, a campaign spokesman said Mr. Perdue was remaining at home until he had more details about the health status of Ms. Loeffler. Mr. Perdue, 70, has encouraged people to wear masks to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. But he has also appeared at rallies where people did not wear masks. A Friday tweet from Ms. Loeffler includes a picture that shows the two senators in an indoor setting without masks. A spokesman for Mr. Pence, Devin O’Malley, said also on Sunday that “as he awaits a confirmatory test from Senator Loeffler, Vice President Pence is in regular consultation with the White House Medical Unit and will be following C.D.C. guidelines as he has in other circumstances when he has been a close contact.” The last time Mr. Pence was deemed a close contact was last month when his chief of staff, Marc Short, tested positive. Mr. Pence continued to campaign then, with the White House saying that he was performing “essential” duties that exempted him from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines calling for people to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to the virus. Ms. Loeffler, a businesswoman who is the Senate’s richest member, was temporarily appointed to her Senate seat late last year. She faces the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, in an election on Jan. 5, when Georgia voters will also decide between Mr. Perdue and his opponent, Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. — Richard Fausset, Annie Karni, Michael Levenson, Astead W.

Shahzaib Akber/EPA, via Shutterstock ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan announced Monday that schools across the country will close for six weeks beginning Nov. 26 as the government confronts a sharp rise in new coronavirus cases. The positivity rate was 7 percent in the past 24 hours with at least 34 deaths, health officials said, a worrying increase compared to the past several weeks. Students will continue taking classes from home until Dec. 24, said Shafqat Mahmood, Pakistan’s federal education minister, during a news conference in Islamabad on Monday. “All educational institutions will be opened on Jan. 11, 2021, after reviewing Covid-19 cases situation in the first week of January,” Mr. Mahmood said, noting that winter break for students would begin Dec. 25 and end on Jan. 10. This is the second time Pakistan has closed schools, resorting to at-home learning back in March and only reopening classrooms in September. “If we don’t make important decisions now, there is a possibility that the spread of the virus will overburden the health care system,” Dr. Faisal Sultan, the special assistant to the Pakistan prime minister on health, said Monday. Pakistan was spared the kind of devastation that crippled other countries this past spring, and officials had expressed optimism that they were prepared for the second wave. But a new wave of infections has now raised concerns about the government’s ability to counter the virus. To date, there have been more than 376,000 recorded cases of coronavirus and nearly 7,700 deaths, according to a Times database. The current daily average number of new cases in Pakistan stands at 2,557. —

As Italy struggles to distribute flu shots, worries mount about its ability to handle virus vaccines. Health workers carried out flu vaccinations at a hospital in Milan, Italy, this month. Credit... Andrea Fasani/EPA, via Shutterstock After suffering through two big outbreaks of the coronavirus, many people in Italy greeted news that a vaccine could be available by early next year with some optimism. But one of the country’s most renowned virologists and Covid-19 experts has provided a reality check about the country’s ability to carry out a mass vaccination drive. He says he hasn’t even been able to get a simple flu shot. “It’s a real scandal,” Dr. Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious disease department at the Sacco hospital in Milan, said Sunday on Italian television. He said that while he hoped the country would eventually be able to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to its citizens, the outlook was “ghastly.” That Dr. Galli, who is 69 and among the most recognizable coronavirus experts in the country, could not get his hands on a simple flu vaccine renewed concerns about a potential lack of preparedness to procure and distribute coronavirus vaccines. Flu shots are far less common in Italy than in the United States, but Italy’s health authorities had urged people to get them this year, both to keep healthy and to allow doctors to focus on Covid-19 patients. But five months later, flu shots are few and far between, and millions of Italians, including older adults and patients with pre-existing conditions, haven’t been able to get them. Some experts say that Italy’s regions, which control health care systems within their borders, placed their orders too late amid enormously high demand in the international marketplace. Regional authorities have instead attributed the shortage to delays by the providers. In the hard-hit Serio valley in northern Italy, Dr. Mario Sorlini said a much higher than usual number of patients asked to be vaccinated for the flu. But the region only sent him about half the doses he received last year. “We were the hardest hit province by Covid, and I was only able to do 25 percent of the flu vaccines I have to do,” Dr. Sorlini said, adding that if he and his colleagues did not receive the doses before the flu comes, it will be a “disaster on top of a disaster.” —

The A.C.L.U. sues a Nebraska meatpacking plant over measures to protect workers from the coronavirus. The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sued a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, alleging that it failed to take measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among workers and, as a result, also imperiled the surrounding community. The lawsuit was filed against Noah’s Ark Processors, which operates a beef-processing plant in Hastings, Neb. Among the plaintiffs are former plant employees and a local pediatrician who has treated children of meatpacking workers as well as people infected with the coronavirus. Noah’s Ark refused to take precautionary measures such as implementing physical distancing, distributing appropriate protective gear or conducting testing for the virus, according to the lawsuit. The plant also kept ailing workers on the job and forced them to wear masks soiled with blood, fat and sweat, the suit said. The meatpacking plant declined to comment. Often immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa, tens of thousands of workers in poultry- and meat-processing plants across the country have fallen ill from the virus and more than 220 have died. They typically toil in cold facilities, standing shoulder to shoulder on production lines and on kill floors. In Nebraska, Hispanics comprise 11 percent of the population but accounted for 60 percent of coronavirus cases in July, according to data released by the state’s health department, because many of them work in the food-processing industry. Despite legislative advocacy and numerous complaints, local, state and federal authorities have failed to require the establishment of safety standards in Nebraska’s meatpacking plants during the pandemic, according to the A.C.L.U., and there has been no significant enforcement action taken against any facility. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring that the plant implement four safeguards: physical distancing, clean masks, sick leave and testing. Attorneys with the A.C.L.U. said they hoped that the measures would serve as a baseline for facilities nationwide. Spencer Amdur, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said that Noah’s Ark had shown “shocking indifference” to its workers by failing to take “common-sense steps.” “Every plant should be providing these basic protections,” said Mr. Amdur. “Without them, workers and others in the community face imminent and severe harm.” —

Los Angeles restaurants brace for new dining restrictions. Some restaurant owners in Los Angeles were upset about new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas. Credit... Ryan Christopher Jones for The New York Times Los Angeles restaurants, many already struggling since indoor dining was disallowed earlier this year, received another blow over the weekend when county health officials announced outdoor dining would also end for three weeks beginning on Wednesday. While restaurants will still be allowed to do takeout and delivery, the timing of the new restrictions couldn’t be worse. The approaching holiday season is usually the busiest period of the year, when many restaurants make the money they need to survive the leaner months of January and February. “Nothing will be the same,” the chef David Chang, the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, which operates Majordomo in Los Angeles, wrote on Twitter. “Even if you survive until spring, it’s 3-5 months before tourism returns and office/corporate business will not come back as before.” On Monday, restaurant owners and chefs scrambled to cancel Thanksgiving reservations while preparing to once again furlough employees. The restaurant Castaway in Burbank had 625 reservations for Thanksgiving lunch and dinner, said John Tallichet, the chief executive of Specialty Restaurants Corporation, which had four restaurants offering outside dining in Los Angeles County. While some of that food will be sold as Thanksgiving meals to go, Mr. Tallichet said much of it will go to the employees he will furlough for three weeks, if not longer. Before the pandemic, Castaway employed 200 people. That number has since dropped to 80 and will fall to around 10 employees as it shifts to a takeout business. “I’m guessing we’re going to be shut down through the holidays,” he said. “Why allow us to operate for New Year’s and Christmas if they’re concerned now? So we’re taking that food and creating care packages for our employees to take home so at least they have a nice Thanksgiving meal.” Some restaurant owners were upset about the new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots and elsewhere with the belief that they would be allowed to continue serving customers that way. “These restaurants have invested $30,000 to $50,000 in outdoor heaters and tents, being told all of this is allowable and safe and now they’re told, ‘nope, all of that investment was a waste,’” said Jot Condie, the president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, a trade organization representing the industry. Restaurants all around the country are struggling with changing rules and consumer preferences as coronavirus cases rise. Last Friday, the New York restaurateur Danny Meyer announced that three of his restaurants, including Gramercy Tavern, would close for on-premises dining, but continue to offer takeout meals. —

It’s not just the Midwest: The U.S. outbreak is accelerating all over the map. A drive-through testing site in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times When infections began rising sharply in the U.S. in September, the growth was driven largely by outbreaks in the Upper Midwest. States like North Dakota and Wisconsin soon became the hardest hit in the nation, relative to their size, and the region continues to struggle. Now, though, with the whole country’s daily average of new cases is as high as it has ever been — over 171,000 — the most rapid growth is happening elsewhere. Nine states are reporting more than twice as many new cases a day as they did two weeks ago, and none of them are in the Midwest. The surges in those states — Arizona, California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Vermont — reflect a still-escalating national crisis. Officials warn that it will only get worse if people disregard warnings about travel and get-togethers for the approaching holidays. “Let me be very clear: A Thanksgiving gathering this year may very well lead to a funeral,” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, whose state is home to five of the 10 metropolitan areas in the country where new case reports are rising the fastest. “The virus is at large,” the governor said. “Know the risks and respect them.” Forty-five states are seeing sustained increases, and 17 states added more cases in the seven-day period that ended Sunday than in any other week of the pandemic. Major metropolitan areas that are reporting new cases at or near record levels are all across the continent: Pittsburgh. Albuquerque. Baltimore. San Diego. Some that have been bad for a while, like El Paso, are coping with the flood of hospitalizations that generally follow a couple of weeks behind a rising tide of new cases. A major hospital group in Arizona, Banner Health, began banning most visitors from its facilities Sunday night because of the worsening spread of the virus.



And where the hospitals come under intense strain, officials are turning, however reluctantly, to impose or reimpose restrictions in the hope of flattening the curve. In Los Angeles County, Calif., which has been averaging more than 3,500 cases a day lately, officials said on Sunday that barring indoor restaurant dining was no longer sufficient, and that outdoor dining would have to shut down as well. “Unfortunately, if our cases and hospitalizations continue to increase, we will need to issue further restrictions to protect our health care system and prevent more deaths,” said Barbara Ferrer, the county public health director. —

AstraZeneca becomes the third major vaccine developer to announce promising results. A volunteer in Oxford, England, last week received the vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times The drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that an early analysis of some of its late-stage clinical trials, conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, showed that its coronavirus vaccine was 70.4 percent effective in preventing Covid-19, suggesting that the world could eventually have at least three working vaccines — and more supply — to help curb the pandemic. The British-Swedish company, which has been developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the third major vaccine developer this month to announce encouraging early results, following Pfizer and Moderna, which both said that their vaccines were about 95 percent effective in late-stage studies. AstraZeneca’s results are a reassuring sign of the safety of the vaccine. It came under global scrutiny after AstraZeneca temporarily paused its trials in September to investigate potential safety issues after a participant in Britain developed a neurological illness. Oxford and AstraZeneca said they would submit their data to regulators in Britain, Europe and Brazil and seek emergency authorization. The company said its early analysis was based on 131 coronavirus cases. The trials used two different dosing regimens, one of which was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 and the other of which was 62 percent effective. The regimen that was 90 percent effective involved using a halved first dose and a standard second dose. Oxford and AstraZeneca also said that there were no hospitalized or severe cases of the coronavirus in anyone who received the vaccine, and that they had seen a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine could reduce transmission. AstraZeneca’s vaccine is expected to come with relatively simple storage requirements, which would be an asset once it gets rolled out. The company has said it anticipates the vaccine will require refrigeration, though it has not provided details about how long and at what temperature it can be kept. Moderna’s vaccine can be kept for up to a month at the temperature of an ordinary refrigerator. Pfizer’s can be kept for up to 5 days in conventional refrigerators, or in special coolers for up to 15 days, but otherwise needs ultracold storage. AstraZeneca has said it aims to bring data from its studies of its vaccine being conducted overseas to the Food and Drug Administration — which would mean that the agency will likely review and authorize a vaccine before late-stage data are ready on how well the vaccine works in American participants. British regulators already have been conducting a so-called rolling review of the vaccine. “Today marks an important milestone in our fight against the pandemic,” AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said. “This vaccine’s efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against Covid-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency.” Professor Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said that “these findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives.” AstraZeneca’s results could significantly strengthen the global effort to produce enough vaccine to create population immunity: The price of the shot, at $3 to $4, is a fraction of that of some other potential vaccines, and AstraZeneca has pledged to make it available at cost around the world until at least July 2021 and in poorer countries in perpetuity. — Rebecca Robbins, Benjamin Mueller and

Cuomo announces new restrictions in Upper Manhattan, Staten Island and other hot spots. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:43 - 0:00 transcript Cuomo Announces New Virus Restrictions Ahead of Thanksgiving Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. We are now coming into the high social season — Thanksgiving, Christmas. It’s the high social season, social activity goes way up in this season. That is a bad combination. Just factor out the current rate of increase. You know, where we are in three weeks? Six thousand cases. That’s before we go into 37 days of the highest socialization period of the year. Yellow Zone in New York City is 2.5, reduces house of worship gatherings. Orange Zone reduces mass gatherings, more businesses close; high risk in an Orange Zone, schools close to clean and test, and then can reopen if they test and the positivity rate is low. New York City, Upper Manhattan is going to become a Yellow Zone. Basically, the Washington Heights area is 3.3. Staten Island, part is a Yellow Zone, part is an Orange Zone. Staten Island is a problem. The number of hospitalizations in Staten Island have gone — over the last three weeks — they basically tripled 33 to 91. It’s a consequence of action. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced new restrictions in parts of the state where coronavirus cases are rising as Thanksgiving approaches, and warned that the state is on track for a further resurgence of the virus. Credit Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times As Thanksgiving approaches, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Monday announced new restrictions in parts of the state where virus cases are rising, including New York City, and issued a grim warning that the state was on track for a further resurgence of the virus. The new restrictions included a zone in Upper Manhattan, the first time the state has rolled back reopening in the borough under its program of targeting so-called microclusters. “These are dangerous times that we’re in,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in New York City. Over the last three weeks, the number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state has more than doubled, to 2,724 on Monday from 1,227 on Nov. 2. The number is a far cry from the peak of the pandemic in the spring, when more than 18,000 people were hospitalized. But Mr. Cuomo warned that if current patterns held, the state would hit 6,000 hospitalizations in another three weeks. The increase could become steeper, he said, if people continued gathering for Thanksgiving and Christmas in the coming weeks, which he called “37 days of the highest socialization of the year.” The governor again warned residents not to travel for the holidays. The state has currently imposed a 10-person limit on private gatherings in hopes of limiting small parties that he has said have contributed to the resurgence of the virus in the state this fall. Parts of Upper Manhattan, including Washington Heights, will now be a yellow zone under the state’s tiered, color-coded restriction system. Gatherings will be limited to 25 people, with houses of worship limited to 50 percent capacity. Restaurants can serve only up to 4 people at a table. Mr. Cuomo also announced an orange zone, the second level of limits, in southern parts of Staten Island. In those areas, indoor dining will close, as will some nonessential businesses deemed to be high risk, such as gyms and personal-care services. All gatherings will be limited to 10 people, with houses of worship limited to 33 percent capacity and 25 people maximum. Other parts of the borough will become a yellow zone. “Staten Island is a problem,” Mr. Cuomo said. The borough has been a hot spot for the virus in the city in recent months. Mr. Cuomo said that hospitalizations there had increased enough that Staten Island was facing a capacity issue. As a result, the state will open an emergency coronavirus patient facility in the South Beach neighborhood, a move reminiscent of field hospitals set up in the spring, when New York City was one of the hardest hit places in the country. The state also announced new yellow zones in parts of Long Island, including Great Neck, Riverhead and Hampton Bays, and expanded yellow and orange zones upstate, around the cities of Rochester and Syracuse. —

Boris Johnson will lift restrictions on many businesses in England beginning next week. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:34 - 0:00 transcript England Will Lift Coronavirus Restrictions The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. The national restrictions in England will end on the 2nd of December, and they will not be renewed. From next Wednesday, people will be able to leave their home for any purpose, and meet others in outdoor public spaces subject to the Rule of 6. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen. But without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a winter or new-year surge. The incidence of the disease is, alas, still widespread in many areas. So we’re not going to replace national measures with a free for all — the status quo ante-Covid — we’re going to go back instead to a regional tiered approach, applying the toughest measures where Covid is most prevalent. I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year. But in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. We all want some kind of Christmas. We need it. We certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that England would return to a tiered system of coronavirus restrictions, and would reopen gyms, stores, and hair salons across the country after the lockdown ends. Credit Credit... Tolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Gyms, stores and hair salons will be allowed to reopen in England next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday, telling lawmakers that for the first time since the spread of the coronavirus the country could “see a route out of the pandemic.” Speaking to Parliament by video link, Mr. Johnson said that he would lift a national lockdown on Dec. 2, as expected, and that England would then return to a regionalized system of restrictions based on three tiers of controls. However, the new plan will keep substantial restrictions on pubs and restaurants — a move that risks friction with some of Mr. Johnson’s own lawmakers, who fear that the hospitality trade will be hit hard by the limitations. Crucially, the government has not yet announced which parts of the country will be subjected to which set of restrictions, though that information is expected later this week. Mr. Johnson, who has been quarantining since last week after being exposed to a member of Parliament who tested positive, hailed the progress announced by the team at Oxford University developing a vaccine with the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, adding that the “scientific cavalry is in sight.” There have been at least 1.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to Public Health England. As of Monday morning, 55,024 people had died. United Kingdom Covid Map and Case Count A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. Under the plan to ease restrictions, gyms, stores and hair salons will reopen and collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports will be allowed to resume in all parts of England. But in the worst-affected parts of the country, pubs and restaurants will stay closed except for takeout service. In some other areas, people will only be able to drink in pubs if they are also eating a meal. Those pubs will, however, be allowed to stay open until 11 p.m., an hour later than had been allowed immediately before the lockdown began, though the bars will have to take last orders for alcohol at 10 p.m. Some spectators will be allowed into sports events, though even in the least-affected parts of England, crowds will be limited to a maximum of 4,000, and in some parts of the country none will be allowed. The package outlined by Mr. Johnson reflected his desire to prevent another surge in virus cases while seeking not to antagonize his backbench lawmakers, who have threatened to rebel over lockdown measures. —

The governor of California is in quarantine with his family after a possible exposure. Dr. Haleh Farzanmehr administered a coronavirus test to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California last month at a testing facility in Valencia, Calif. Credit... Pool photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has gone into quarantine, along with his family, after three of the governor’s children were exposed to a state highway patrol officer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s whole family — Mr. Newsom; his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom; and their four children — tested negative for the virus on Sunday, but will stay apart from other people for two weeks anyway, in compliance with state guidelines, his office said. “We are grateful for all the officers that keep our family safe and for every frontline worker who continues to go to work during this pandemic,” the governor said on Twitter. The Newsoms learned of the exposure on Friday evening, the governor’s office said. The whole family waited until Sunday to be tested in order to reduce the likelihood of a false negative result (it can take time for the virus to build up to detectable levels after infection). The governor and his partner did not come in direct contact with the officer. One of the Newsom children was already in quarantine after a classmate tested positive, Politico reported on Friday. The governor has come under fire for sending his children back to their private school classrooms while many public schools in the state remained closed and most families had to adapt to at-home learning. Mr. Newsom has also faced outrage over his recent decision to attend a birthday dinner at a restaurant in Napa Valley with members of several other households. With infections and hospitalizations each rising at an alarming rate in the state, officials announced a curfew last week, and some counties and the state have reimposed sweeping restrictions they had been gradually lifting. According to a New York Times database, the state has reported an average of 11,802 new cases a day over the last week, a sharp increase from a month ago. The figure exceeds the state’s earlier peak of just over 10,000 new cases a day in late July. The curfew bars nearly all Californians from being away from their homes from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. except for essential purposes, and is scheduled to last through Dec. 21. In Los Angeles County, where indoor dining has been shuttered for months and virus cases are still surging, health officials took the additional step on Sunday of closing down outdoor dining “to reduce the possibility for crowding and the potential for exposure.” That order takes effect on Wednesday, just before Thanksgiving. —

A C.D.C. advisory group discussed which Americans should get vaccines first. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the C.D.C. indicated in a meeting on Monday that health care workers should be the first recipients of coronavirus vaccines. Credit... Go Nakamura/Getty Images An expert committee charged with deciding which Americans should be first in line for a coronavirus vaccine met on Monday afternoon to discuss a number of questions before it votes — likely by mid-December — on final recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After the group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, delivers its recommendations, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, will quickly decide whether to approve them. That will be the final step, after a review by the Food and Drug Administration and its own advisory committee on vaccines, before the first doses of vaccine are shipped nationwide. A subgroup of the committee had already suggested that health care workers, who total about 21 million, should be the first to be vaccinated. On Monday, it recommended also including residents of long-term care facilities in that initial group. Next would be essential workers, then adults with high-risk medical conditions and those who are 65 or older. Some of the questions the committee considered Monday included: Whether people who have already had Covid-19 should not be vaccinated until there is ample supply. Dr. Robert Atmar, a committee member and infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that “at the beginning, where it’s a resource-limited vaccine, my opinion is that we need to try and target as best we can to those that we know are susceptible.” But another committee member, Dr. Grace Lee, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, pushed back, saying that much remains unknown about long-term immunity.

Whether essential workers like police, firefighters, teachers and transportation workers should be the second group to get the vaccine. “To me, the issue of ethics is very significant, very important for this country and clearly favors the essential worker group,” said Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles, noting that the group included a “high proportion of minority, low-income and low-education workers.” —

A new analysis shows how political divisions impacted attitudes toward restrictions. Demonstrators protested ‘Stay Home, Stay Healthy’ orders in Washington State in April. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic last spring quickly became politicized, forcing officials and citizens around the world to choose between public health and personal freedom. In the United States, the tension broke down roughly along ideological lines, with many blue states taking containment measures seriously, and red states less so. In a new analysis, a team of researchers provided some of the first hard evidence of how the political divide drove behavior. The paper, posted Monday by the journal Nature Human Behavior, found that one measure of partisan hostility — the intensity of distrust and animosity toward the other side, red or blue — correlated both with people’s attitudes toward containment policies, and how they behaved. The findings were based on interviews with more than 2,400 adults, conducted once in the summer of 2019 and again in April of this year. The research team, led by James Druckman, a political scientist at Northwestern University, found that the average Democrat “is more worried, is more likely to have changed behaviors and is more supportive of policies to stop the spread of infections than the average Republican,” although there were substantial overlaps in attitudes. The research team, which included scientists from the University of Arizona, Stony Brook University and the University of Pennsylvania, determined that in the hardest hit areas, these differences shrank. In effect, concern for personal and family safety blunted the effect of partisanship, as most everyone responded to the local outbreak. “These findings have implications for understanding how best to combat COVID-19,” the authors concluded. Since partisan hostility underlies partisan gaps, “policymakers will need to devise different strategies to bring the parties together on these issues.” —

More than one million travelers were screened at airports on Sunday, a new high in the pandemic. Travelers at Miami International Airport on Sunday. Experts have been strongly discouraging holiday travel. Credit... David Santiago/Miami Herald, via Associated Press More travelers were screened at airport security checkpoints on Sunday than on any day since the pandemic took hold in March, a worrying sign that people flying to visit their families for Thanksgiving could increase the spread of the coronavirus. A little more than one million people were screened by the Transportation Security Administration on Sunday, according to federal data published on Monday. That number is about half of what it was in 2019, but it represents a big increase from the spring, when less than a half a million people flew on any given day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, have been strongly discouraging holiday travel for fear that it would increase the number of new infections, which have surged in recent weeks as the weather turns colder and more people spend time indoors. Airlines have said that flying is safe because of the precautions the industry has put in place, like high-end air filtration. They also point to the relatively few published cases of the coronavirus being spread during a flight. But the science on in-flight safety is far from settled, and travelers would still be at risk of contracting or spreading the virus at airports and once they are at their destination. The increase in travel during the holidays has been encouraging for airlines. But it won’t be enough to offset the deep losses they have suffered during the pandemic. The nation’s largest airlines have collectively reported tens of billions of dollars in losses so far this year, and analysts expect demand to remain weak for a couple of years or more. The industry is hoping that the incoming Biden administration and Congress will give airlines more aid early next year.

Adoptee reunions were disrupted by the pandemic. Some still found a way. Mallory Guy, right, used a translation app to communicate with her birth mother, Lim Mi-Soon. Credit... Jun Michael Park for The New York Times When a taxi deposited Mallory Guy in front of an apartment building in Cheonan, South Korea, after a 14-hour flight from Atlanta, a Korean couple was waiting for her with open arms. It was the first time since she was 7 months old that Ms. Guy, 33, had been in the country where she was born. It was also her first time seeing her birth parents since she was sent to the United States more than three decades ago. For some adoptees, birth family reunions had become a rite of passage. Then came the pandemic. The pilgrimages back to South Korea dwindled. Many adoptees canceled long-planned reunions after the government’s quarantine rules for foreign visitors made the trips too costly and time-consuming. When Ms. Guy arrived in South Korea in September, she did not know whether she would be allowed to spend the two weeks at her biological parents’ home or be forced to stay at a costly government hotel. The South Korean Embassy’s website said only that such decisions were made on a case-by-case basis. Her parents made Korean food for her and American snacks like peanut butter and jelly. (They also stocked up on milk, because they had heard that Americans love milk.) They even bought her an exercise bike, because she had told them during calls that she enjoyed using her Peloton. After two weeks of immersion in her parents’ home, Ms. Guy took a coronavirus test, as mandated by the government, so she could leave quarantine and explore her home country with her family. When a testing administrator asked her when she had last left the country for the United States, “I told her 1987, and she looked super-confused.” The worker asked again, and Ms. Guy confirmed that she understood the question. After telling her 1987 four more times, Ms. Guy said, “she finally wrote it down.” —

Tami Chappell/EPA, via Shutterstock Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, a Republican who is campaigning in a high-stakes runoff election that could determine control of the Senate, plans to get “back out on the campaign trail” after receiving her second consecutive negative coronavirus test, a campaign spokesman said on Monday. This comes after Ms. Loeffler’s campaign on Sunday said she was isolating “out of an abundance of caution” after a series of coronavirus tests delivered mixed messages about whether she had contracted the disease. According to Stephen Lawson, a campaign spokesman, a rapid test Ms. Loeffler took Friday morning came back negative, but a second test she also took that morning — a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test, which is considered more accurate — returned a positive result on Friday evening. In between her receipt of the two conflicting test results, Ms. Loeffler attended campaign-related events on Friday, including a rally with Vice President Mike Pence and Senator David Perdue of Georgia, Mr. Lawson said. Ms. Loeffler, 49, received another P.C.R. test on Saturday morning. But it was “inconclusive,” Mr. Lawson said of the results, which came in Saturday evening. On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Lawson issued another statement saying that the senator’s “previously inconclusive P.C.R. results were retested overnight and the results thankfully came back negative.” The negative result on Monday was also from a P.C.R. test. He added: “Out of an abundance of caution, she will continue to self-isolate and be retested again to hopefully receive consecutive negative test results. We will share those results as they are made available. She will continue to confer with medical experts and follow C.D.C. guidelines.” Ms. Loeffler notified those with whom she had sustained contact while she awaits further test results, he said. Ms. Loeffler has held recent events with prominent Republicans, including Mr. Pence, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mr. Perdue, who is also engaged in a runoff election that could determine control of the Senate. On Sunday, a campaign spokesman said Mr. Perdue was remaining at home until he had more details about the health status of Ms. Loeffler. Mr. Perdue, 70, has encouraged people to wear masks to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. But he has also appeared at rallies where people did not wear masks. A Friday tweet from Ms. Loeffler includes a picture that shows the two senators in an indoor setting without masks. A spokesman for Mr. Pence, Devin O’Malley, said also on Sunday that “as he awaits a confirmatory test from Senator Loeffler, Vice President Pence is in regular consultation with the White House Medical Unit and will be following C.D.C. guidelines as he has in other circumstances when he has been a close contact.” The last time Mr. Pence was deemed a close contact was last month when his chief of staff, Marc Short, tested positive. Mr. Pence continued to campaign then, with the White House saying that he was performing “essential” duties that exempted him from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines calling for people to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to the virus. Ms. Loeffler, a businesswoman who is the Senate’s richest member, was temporarily appointed to her Senate seat late last year. She faces the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, in an election on Jan. 5, when Georgia voters will also decide between Mr. Perdue and his opponent, Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. — Richard Fausset, Annie Karni, Michael Levenson, Astead W.

Shahzaib Akber/EPA, via Shutterstock ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan announced Monday that schools across the country will close for six weeks beginning Nov. 26 as the government confronts a sharp rise in new coronavirus cases. The positivity rate was 7 percent in the past 24 hours with at least 34 deaths, health officials said, a worrying increase compared to the past several weeks. Students will continue taking classes from home until Dec. 24, said Shafqat Mahmood, Pakistan’s federal education minister, during a news conference in Islamabad on Monday. “All educational institutions will be opened on Jan. 11, 2021, after reviewing Covid-19 cases situation in the first week of January,” Mr. Mahmood said, noting that winter break for students would begin Dec. 25 and end on Jan. 10. This is the second time Pakistan has closed schools, resorting to at-home learning back in March and only reopening classrooms in September. “If we don’t make important decisions now, there is a possibility that the spread of the virus will overburden the health care system,” Dr. Faisal Sultan, the special assistant to the Pakistan prime minister on health, said Monday. Pakistan was spared the kind of devastation that crippled other countries this past spring, and officials had expressed optimism that they were prepared for the second wave. But a new wave of infections has now raised concerns about the government’s ability to counter the virus. To date, there have been more than 376,000 recorded cases of coronavirus and nearly 7,700 deaths, according to a Times database. The current daily average number of new cases in Pakistan stands at 2,557. —

As Italy struggles to distribute flu shots, worries mount about its ability to handle virus vaccines. Health workers carried out flu vaccinations at a hospital in Milan, Italy, this month. Credit... Andrea Fasani/EPA, via Shutterstock After suffering through two big outbreaks of the coronavirus, many people in Italy greeted news that a vaccine could be available by early next year with some optimism. But one of the country’s most renowned virologists and Covid-19 experts has provided a reality check about the country’s ability to carry out a mass vaccination drive. He says he hasn’t even been able to get a simple flu shot. “It’s a real scandal,” Dr. Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious disease department at the Sacco hospital in Milan, said Sunday on Italian television. He said that while he hoped the country would eventually be able to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to its citizens, the outlook was “ghastly.” That Dr. Galli, who is 69 and among the most recognizable coronavirus experts in the country, could not get his hands on a simple flu vaccine renewed concerns about a potential lack of preparedness to procure and distribute coronavirus vaccines. Flu shots are far less common in Italy than in the United States, but Italy’s health authorities had urged people to get them this year, both to keep healthy and to allow doctors to focus on Covid-19 patients. But five months later, flu shots are few and far between, and millions of Italians, including older adults and patients with pre-existing conditions, haven’t been able to get them. Some experts say that Italy’s regions, which control health care systems within their borders, placed their orders too late amid enormously high demand in the international marketplace. Regional authorities have instead attributed the shortage to delays by the providers. In the hard-hit Serio valley in northern Italy, Dr. Mario Sorlini said a much higher than usual number of patients asked to be vaccinated for the flu. But the region only sent him about half the doses he received last year. “We were the hardest hit province by Covid, and I was only able to do 25 percent of the flu vaccines I have to do,” Dr. Sorlini said, adding that if he and his colleagues did not receive the doses before the flu comes, it will be a “disaster on top of a disaster.” —

The A.C.L.U. sues a Nebraska meatpacking plant over measures to protect workers from the coronavirus. The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sued a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, alleging that it failed to take measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among workers and, as a result, also imperiled the surrounding community. The lawsuit was filed against Noah’s Ark Processors, which operates a beef-processing plant in Hastings, Neb. Among the plaintiffs are former plant employees and a local pediatrician who has treated children of meatpacking workers as well as people infected with the coronavirus. Noah’s Ark refused to take precautionary measures such as implementing physical distancing, distributing appropriate protective gear or conducting testing for the virus, according to the lawsuit. The plant also kept ailing workers on the job and forced them to wear masks soiled with blood, fat and sweat, the suit said. The meatpacking plant declined to comment. Often immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa, tens of thousands of workers in poultry- and meat-processing plants across the country have fallen ill from the virus and more than 220 have died. They typically toil in cold facilities, standing shoulder to shoulder on production lines and on kill floors. In Nebraska, Hispanics comprise 11 percent of the population but accounted for 60 percent of coronavirus cases in July, according to data released by the state’s health department, because many of them work in the food-processing industry. Despite legislative advocacy and numerous complaints, local, state and federal authorities have failed to require the establishment of safety standards in Nebraska’s meatpacking plants during the pandemic, according to the A.C.L.U., and there has been no significant enforcement action taken against any facility. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring that the plant implement four safeguards: physical distancing, clean masks, sick leave and testing. Attorneys with the A.C.L.U. said they hoped that the measures would serve as a baseline for facilities nationwide. Spencer Amdur, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said that Noah’s Ark had shown “shocking indifference” to its workers by failing to take “common-sense steps.” “Every plant should be providing these basic protections,” said Mr. Amdur. “Without them, workers and others in the community face imminent and severe harm.” —

Los Angeles restaurants brace for new dining restrictions. Some restaurant owners in Los Angeles were upset about new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas. Credit... Ryan Christopher Jones for The New York Times Los Angeles restaurants, many already struggling since indoor dining was disallowed earlier this year, received another blow over the weekend when county health officials announced outdoor dining would also end for three weeks beginning on Wednesday. While restaurants will still be allowed to do takeout and delivery, the timing of the new restrictions couldn’t be worse. The approaching holiday season is usually the busiest period of the year, when many restaurants make the money they need to survive the leaner months of January and February. “Nothing will be the same,” the chef David Chang, the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group, which operates Majordomo in Los Angeles, wrote on Twitter. “Even if you survive until spring, it’s 3-5 months before tourism returns and office/corporate business will not come back as before.” On Monday, restaurant owners and chefs scrambled to cancel Thanksgiving reservations while preparing to once again furlough employees. The restaurant Castaway in Burbank had 625 reservations for Thanksgiving lunch and dinner, said John Tallichet, the chief executive of Specialty Restaurants Corporation, which had four restaurants offering outside dining in Los Angeles County. While some of that food will be sold as Thanksgiving meals to go, Mr. Tallichet said much of it will go to the employees he will furlough for three weeks, if not longer. Before the pandemic, Castaway employed 200 people. That number has since dropped to 80 and will fall to around 10 employees as it shifts to a takeout business. “I’m guessing we’re going to be shut down through the holidays,” he said. “Why allow us to operate for New Year’s and Christmas if they’re concerned now? So we’re taking that food and creating care packages for our employees to take home so at least they have a nice Thanksgiving meal.” Some restaurant owners were upset about the new restrictions because they had spent thousands of dollars creating outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots and elsewhere with the belief that they would be allowed to continue serving customers that way. “These restaurants have invested $30,000 to $50,000 in outdoor heaters and tents, being told all of this is allowable and safe and now they’re told, ‘nope, all of that investment was a waste,’” said Jot Condie, the president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, a trade organization representing the industry. Restaurants all around the country are struggling with changing rules and consumer preferences as coronavirus cases rise. Last Friday, the New York restaurateur Danny Meyer announced that three of his restaurants, including Gramercy Tavern, would close for on-premises dining, but continue to offer takeout meals. —

A sign marks the headquarters of Moderna Therapeutics, which is developing a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., May 18, 2020. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

Following are reactions to the news.

ANNA BLAKNEY, RESEARCH FELLOW AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON’S DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PART OF IMPERIAL’S COVID VACCINE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

“I think the results from Moderna are equally exciting - the protection is very similar to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. While the formulation only needs to be frozen at -20C, which makes distribution less of a logistical nightmare, the dose of mRNA they use is much higher (100 µg) so this may impact the rate at which they’re able to produce doses.”

PROF. BODO PLACHTER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGIE, MAINZ UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL, GERMANY

“Moderna has the advantage (over Pfizer) that they can already provide detailed findings on aspects such as severe disease, age and side effects.

“The question remains: What will protection look like after three, six or 12 months. It is fair to assume that it will last at least a year but we can’t be sure at this point.

“The side effects are within a range that would be expected of many other vaccines, such as shingles vaccine Shingrix.”

WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

“Now we know that the vaccine appears to be highly effective. It also seems like we really need the vaccine right now, because we have no coherent national strategy. And the next two months are looking dismal. So there, there has to be some willingness for uncertainty and flexibility in times of crisis... FDA can safely schedule this committee sometime soon.

“If you look at the state of the pandemic right now, and the exponential rise and the stress on the healthcare system, and the assumption that that’s going to get worse, the rising cases in nursing home, the Thanksgiving holiday, and later Christmas holiday and other holidays, all of that is an environment, that it’s just going to add fuel to the fire... with the rate things are moving and the holidays, actually two or three weeks, I think makes a big difference right now.”

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, THE TOP U.S. INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT, SAID ON A CALL WITH REPORTERS:

“The vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Fauci urged Americans not to let their guard down because of this news, but to continue washing hands, avoiding crowds and being vigilant about social distancing.

ZOLTAN KIS, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE FUTURE VACCINE MANUFACTURING HUB, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

“If mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 gain regulatory approval, this will be a huge validation of the RNA vaccine production platform technology.

“Using this technology, vaccine candidates can be produced substantially faster in the future to combat virtually any infectious disease, by producing vaccines against both existing pathogens and future, currently unknown pathogens.

“Vaccine candidates can be produced against virtually any disease, because this is a platform technology, meaning that the production process, the purification processes and the formulation processes can remain the same no matter what vaccine or vaccine candidate is produced.

“This is a huge advantage in terms of the speed at which vaccine candidates can be developed and produced in the future.

“In the case of conventional vaccine production technologies, each vaccine required the development of a new production process, whereas in the case of the RNA vaccine production platform technology one process can produce vaccines and vaccine candidates against virtually any disease.”

PENNY WARD, VISITING PROFESSOR IN PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE AT KING’S COLLEGE LONDON AND CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION AND STANDARDS COMMITTEE OF THE FACULTY OF PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE

“Given the general similarity of the vaccine target and the immunological responses observed for all vaccines, these data generally suggest that vaccination will protect against severe illness and thereby should protect people from needing hospitalization or from dying from COVID.

“We still need to know if there is protection against infection, as the latter leads to herd protection while protection against illness has a value for an individual it will not prevent circulation of virus and risk of disease in unvaccinated persons, or in people not responding adequately to vaccination.”

RICHARD HATCHETT, CEO OF THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS (CEPI)

(CEPI was set up in 2017 to fight emerging epidemics and is backed by 14 governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Britain’s Wellcome Trust)

“The Moderna results are as good as we could have hoped for and really terrifically encouraging.

“Moderna has also released information which suggests that the vaccine may protect against more severe disease (although they don’t address the statistical significance of this finding), and the reported side effects appear to be manageable.

“The fact that the vaccine shows stability when stored in a normal refrigerator for up to 30 days is also terrific news and will allow the vaccine to be distributed broadly.”

ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL

“This vaccine would be much easier to transport and administer than the one from Pfizer. Also the preliminary evidence suggests that it can prevent severe COVID-19 disease. However the Moderna vaccine is more expensive and there are fewer doses available in the next year.”

“No vaccine company has enough supplies available to protect everyone in need. We will need all the available vaccines with over 90% efficacy to cover global demand.”

ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH

“Although the numbers are small, this trial also gives an indication that vaccination is effective in older and BAME individuals and prevents severe disease, all of which are key to allowing the world to start opening up again. The absolute prerequisite for a COVID-19 vaccine is that it stops people becoming ill enough to require hospital treatment and stops people dying. The preliminary data reported here suggest that this vaccine – and by extension, the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine – will achieve this goal.

“The safety data also look promising. The side effects of vaccination appear to be in line with those typically seen for other adult vaccinations, including the seasonal influenza vaccination which is administered in many millions of doses every year.

“One important unknown is whether this vaccine, or any of the vaccines currently in trials, prevents disease transmission. It is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don’t yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities.

“But, overall, this is excellent news. Having more than one source of an effective vaccine will increase the global supply and, with luck, help us all to get back to something like normal sometime in 2021.”

PROF TRUDIE LANG, DIRECTOR, THE GLOBAL HEALTH NETWORK, NUFFIELD DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

“It is very good news indeed to see another vaccine coming through with similar efficacy results as were reported last week from Pfizer. This is also an interim analysis, which means that there were enough cases within the vaccinated volunteers to give statistical significance and allow the team to break the blind to determine who had the active vaccine and who had placebo.

“Here they found that of 95 cases of COVID, 90 had received the placebo and five the active vaccine. These early results suggest that there was a representation across different age groups and diverse communities in the protected group. This is really encouraging and it further demonstrates that a vaccine for COVID is a real probability and that having more than one supplier should help assure better and more equitable global availability.

“This vaccine is also an mRNA vaccine, so many of the same questions remain as we have been discussing with the Pfizer vaccine and these will be looked at carefully by the regulators.”

STEPHEN EVANS, PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE & TROPICAL MEDICINE

“This announcement from Moderna is a further encouragement that vaccines will be found to not only have an acceptable efficacy, but an efficacy that is much greater than we had anticipated. This press release is more specific than that of others, in that it confirms the numbers in each group, which was able to be guessed at but to have it confirmed is helpful.

“The range of minor adverse effects reported are unsurprising and typical of almost any vaccine. These reactions tend to be local to where the injection was given and are rarely long-lasting or severe.

“Although they reported efficacy being over 94%, there is statistical uncertainty in this; but based on these data, the likely efficacy will be better than 85% which would be greater than most scientists would have expected.

“This is the first study to report on severe cases and, while uncertainty remains, the finding of no severe cases with the vaccine and 11 cases with placebo is very strong evidence that the vaccine prevents severe as well as mild disease. It is likely that convincing evidence in respect to deaths will probably only be obtained when the vaccine is in use.

“A wide range of people with illnesses and from minority groups were included in the trials as well as substantial numbers of older patients. We will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress.”

PETER OPENSHAW, PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON

“This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months.”

“This latest press release is based on a study of 30,000 U.S. adults, including many high-risk or elderly persons. This gives us confidence that the results are relevant in the people who are most at risk of COVID-19 and in most need of the vaccines.”

“Moderna have also announced that the vaccine can be kept in a conventional freezer (-20 degrees Celsius) for up to 6 months, and that once thawed the vaccine can be kept for up to 30 days at standard refrigerator (2 to 8 degrees centigrade). This makes the vaccine much easier to deliver.

“In terms of side effects, news is also quite good. The first dose caused injection site pain in about 3% of people; the second dose was associated with transient generalized symptoms in about 10% of people with fatigue, muscle aches and flu like symptoms. This seems to indicate that they got the dose about right with acceptable adverse events. These effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response.”

“We need more complete details than we have in this press release, but this announcement adds to the general feeling of optimism about vaccines for Covid-19. What we still don’t know is how long any protective immunity may last. For that, we will need to wait.”

Corporate reaction:

ALBERT BOURLA, CEO OF PFIZER, SAID ON TWITTER:

“I am thrilled to hear the good news coming out of @moderna_tx’s #COVID19 vaccine development programme. Our companies share a common goal – defeating this dreaded disease – and today we congratulate everyone at Moderna and share in the joy of their encouraging results.”

KIRILL DMITRIEV, CEO OF RUSSIA’S RDIF, WHICH IS MARKETING RUSSIA’S SPUTNIK V VACCINE, WAS QUOTED ON SPUTNIK V TWITTER FEED:

“Very pleased with positive news from Moderna, the world needs a portfolio of vaccines. Vaccines with 90% plus efficiency are very promising, can save lives and restore economic growth”.

Political reaction:

U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID ON TWITTER:

“Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great “historians”, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”

U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN SAID ON TWITTER:

“Today’s news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful.”

“What was true with the first vaccine remains true with the second: we are still months away. Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control.”

ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES, SAID ON TWITTER:

“This news is another stunning result of President Trump’s leadership and his unwavering support for #OperationWarpSpeed, an incredible tribute to American scientists and innovators, and one more reminder that there is light at the end of the tunnel.”

FRANCIS COLLINS, DIRECTOR OF U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, SAID IN A MEDIA CALL

“This really is a significant milestone, two Monday mornings in a row with remarkable results to report of interim analysis of COVID-19 vaccine trials.

“As Tony Fauci has said, that means the cavalry is coming.”

Market reaction:

BRAD LONCAR, HEALTHCARE INVESTOR, CEO OF LONCAR INVESTMENTS, KANSAS CITY

“It’s really incredible to think back to January and February, messenger RNA was a totally unproven technology for anything, let alone vaccines. And you have to give a lot of credit to these companies. And you have to give a lot of credit to Dr. Fauci. It was a big bet - it was a risky thing to bet on.

“It’s hugely important that now two vaccines have succeeded, instead of just one. The entire country and the entire world is going to need to get vaccinated one day, and we need many vaccines. We need more than just these two to succeed, because we’re going to be capacity constrained.

“(Moderna and Pfizer) should be filing for approval within the next two to three weeks. And I think it’s fair to say that both of these will likely be approved in early to mid December. And I think that the first group - healthcare workers and people like that - will be vaccinated before the end of the year.

“To the extent that the Moderna one makes it easier logistically to deliver and specifically store, that’s a hugely important thing. Probably the people who will benefit most from it are people who traditionally don’t have the highest access to healthcare - people in rural areas or poorer countries.”Expert views: Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 - Reuters<ol><li>Expert views: Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19  Reuters

Following are reactions to the news.

ANNA BLAKNEY, RESEARCH FELLOW AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON’S DEPARTMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PART OF IMPERIAL’S COVID VACCINE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

“I think the results from Moderna are equally exciting - the protection is very similar to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. While the formulation only needs to be frozen at -20C, which makes distribution less of a logistical nightmare, the dose of mRNA they use is much higher (100 µg) so this may impact the rate at which they’re able to produce doses.”

PROF. BODO PLACHTER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGIE, MAINZ UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL, GERMANY

“Moderna has the advantage (over Pfizer) that they can already provide detailed findings on aspects such as severe disease, age and side effects.

“The question remains: What will protection look like after three, six or 12 months. It is fair to assume that it will last at least a year but we can’t be sure at this point.

“The side effects are within a range that would be expected of many other vaccines, such as shingles vaccine Shingrix.”

WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

“Now we know that the vaccine appears to be highly effective. It also seems like we really need the vaccine right now, because we have no coherent national strategy. And the next two months are looking dismal. So there, there has to be some willingness for uncertainty and flexibility in times of crisis... FDA can safely schedule this committee sometime soon.

“If you look at the state of the pandemic right now, and the exponential rise and the stress on the healthcare system, and the assumption that that’s going to get worse, the rising cases in nursing home, the Thanksgiving holiday, and later Christmas holiday and other holidays, all of that is an environment, that it’s just going to add fuel to the fire... with the rate things are moving and the holidays, actually two or three weeks, I think makes a big difference right now.”

</li><li>Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is…WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday said he hopes there will be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020.

"The Pfizer one (vaccine) is a very promising one, we also expect more and more," said Tedros. He reiterated the United Nations agency's call for an equitable distribution of vaccine doses once they are available.

He said the WHO team studying origin of virus has experts from US, Russia, Australia, Sudan, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Vietnam and Britain.

Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa, told the same WHO ministerial assembly: "The exciting news yesterday (Monday) of a possible effective vaccine becoming available presages significant cold chains challenges for African countries by the type of vaccine that that is. Which will need to be factored into the support to be provided."

The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the extent of its coronavirus outbreak, called on Tuesday for a "transparent and inclusive" WHO-led international investigation into the origin of the pandemic, criticising its current terms.

The Trump administration has accused the World Health Organization of being "China-centric" and of being its puppet, which WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has denied.

Tedros on Monday welcomed efforts to strengthen the Geneva-based body through reform and said it was looking forward to working closely with the administration of US President-elect Joe Biden.

WHO's funding must become more flexible and predictable to end a "major misalignment" between expectations and available resources, WHO director-general said, citing reform efforts by France, Germany and the European Union.

"We welcome the encouraging vaccine news from @pfizer & @BioNTech_Group & salute all scientists & partners around the who are developing new safe, efficacious tools to beat #COVID19," WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.

"The world is experiencing unprecedented scientific innovation & collaboration to end the pandemic," he said.

As of mid-October, the WHO has identified 42 "candidate vaccines" at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.

Ten of them were at the most advanced phase 3 stage, in which a vaccine's effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.

Elicio Therapeutics Announces Poster Presentation at 2020 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual MeetingCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- #COVID19--Elicio Therapeutics, a next generation immunotherapy company, today announced virtual poster presentations for the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) Annual Meeting November 9-14, 2020. The presentations…CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elicio Therapeutics, a next generation immunotherapy company, today announced virtual poster presentations for the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) Annual Meeting November 9-14, 2020. The presentations will update progress in two IND-ready programs demonstrating the broad application of Elicio’s Amphiphile Platform, one for a protein subunit vaccine for COVID-19; the other targeting the seven mutations commonly present in KRAS driven cancers, approximately 25% of all human solid tumors.

Presentation Details:

Posters Online (access on SITC website): November 11 to November 14, 09:00 - 17:00 EST

Poster Q&A: November 11 at 17:15 – 17:45 EST & November 13 at 16:40–17:10 EST

Poster 1 Title: Lymph node-targeted AMP-vaccine enables tumor-directed mKRAS-specific immune responses with potent polyfunctional and cytolytic activity. Abstract Number: 479

Authors: Martin Steinbuck, PhD; Lochana Seenappa, MS; PhD; Peter C. DeMuth, PhD;

Synopsis:

ELI-002 components (AMP-mKRAS peptide antigens and AMP-CpG) are effectively delivered to lymph nodes where they are efficiently delivered to innate immune cells

ELI-002 induces potent mKRAS-specific T cells after vaccination in mice; comparator vaccines composed of conventional peptides and adjuvants produce no detectable T cell responses

ELI-002-induced T cells are highly functional, producing multiple effector cytokines upon stimulation directly ex vivo

ELI-002-induced T cells demonstrate cytolytic activity against mKRAS-presenting target cells in vivo

Poster 2 Title: A lymph-node targeted amphiphile vaccine induces potent cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Abstract Number: 723

Authors: Martin Steinbuck, PhD; Lochana Seenappa, MS; Aniela Jakubowski; Lisa K. McNeil, PhD; Christopher M. Haqq, MD, PhD; Peter C. DeMuth, PhD;

Synopsis:

ELI-005 (Spike RBD + AMP-CpG) induced highly potent T cell and antibody immunity specific to SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD

Polyfunctional cytokine secreting T cell responses were detected directly ex vivo in blood, spleen, and lung tissues; ELI-005 generated response frequencies significantly higher than those induced by Alum or soluble CpG comparator groups

ELI-005-induced neutralizing antibody responses were observed at levels significantly higher than found in convalescent human patient samples

Vaccination with AMP-CpG in ELI-005 allowed for 10x dose reduction of RBD protein antigen without any decrease in the magnitude or functionality of induced T cell or neutralizing antibody responses

ELI-005 produced enhanced T cell and antibody responses in aged mice, exceeding those generated by Alum or soluble CpG adjuvanted vaccines

Elicio’s posters will also be made available on the News section of Elicio’s website.

About the Amphiphile Platform

The Elicio Amphiphile platform enables precise targeting and delivery of immunogens and cell-therapy activators directly to the lymphatic system, the “brain center” of the immune response, to significantly amplify and enhance the body’s own system of defenses, defeat solid and hematologic cancers, and prevent their recurrence. Once in the lymph nodes, Amphiphile immunotherapies are taken up by antigen presenting cells (APC’s) to orchestrate signaling to natural or engineered immune cells in order to maximize therapeutic immune responses to disease. This strategy has been used to improve the activity of immunostimulatory agents, antigens, adjuvants, and cell-therapies that generate little to no response when used in the conventional forms. By precisely targeting these immunotherapies to the lymph nodes, Amphiphiles can unlock their full potential to generate and amplify anti-tumor immune responses. This substantially enhanced anti-tumor functionality and long-term protective memory may someday unlock the full potential of the immune response to eliminate cancer.

Poster 1 Title: Lymph node-targeted AMP-vaccine enables tumor-directed mKRAS-specific immune responses with potent polyfunctional and cytolytic activity. Abstract Number: 479

Authors: Martin Steinbuck, PhD; Lochana Seenappa, MS; PhD; Peter C. DeMuth, PhD;

Synopsis:

ELI-002 components (AMP-mKRAS peptide antigens and AMP-CpG) are effectively delivered to lymph nodes where they are efficiently delivered to innate immune cells

ELI-002 induces potent mKRAS-specific T cells after vaccination in mice; comparator vaccines composed of conventional peptides and adjuvants produce no detectable T cell responses

ELI-002-induced T cells are highly functional, producing multiple effector cytokines upon stimulation directly ex vivo

ELI-002-induced T cells demonstrate cytolytic activity against mKRAS-presenting target cells in vivo

Poster 2 Title: A lymph-node targeted amphiphile vaccine induces potent cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Abstract Number: 723

Authors: Martin Steinbuck, PhD; Lochana Seenappa, MS; Aniela Jakubowski; Lisa K. McNeil, PhD; Christopher M. Haqq, MD, PhD; Peter C. DeMuth, PhD;

Synopsis:

ELI-005 (Spike RBD + AMP-CpG) induced highly potent T cell and antibody immunity specific to SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD

Polyfunctional cytokine secreting T cell responses were detected directly ex vivo in blood, spleen, and lung tissues; ELI-005 generated response frequencies significantly higher than those induced by Alum or soluble CpG comparator groups

ELI-005-induced neutralizing antibody responses were observed at levels significantly higher than found in convalescent human patient samples

Vaccination with AMP-CpG in ELI-005 allowed for 10x dose reduction of RBD protein antigen without any decrease in the magnitude or functionality of induced T cell or neutralizing antibody responses

ELI-005 produced enhanced T cell and antibody responses in aged mice, exceeding those generated by Alum or soluble CpG adjuvanted vaccines

Elicio’s posters will also be made available on the News section of Elicio’s website.

Covid-19 Vaccination Plan: Badan POM Set to Ensure and Safeguard the safety, efficacy, and quality of Covid-19 vaccineIn a bid to support the government's plan to develop Covid-19 vaccine in Indonesia, the National Drug and Food Monitoring Agency (Badan POM) reveals three top priorities for vaccine development: safety, efficacy, and quality. As part of the Covid-19 Handling …Prudent approach and usability are among the top priorities

Efforts are underway to provide the best efficacy for public at large

JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- In a bid to support the government's plan to develop Covid-19 vaccine in Indonesia, the National Drug and Food Monitoring Agency (Badan POM) reveals three top priorities for vaccine development: safety, efficacy, and quality. As part of the Covid-19 Handling and National Economic Recovery Committee (KPCPEN), top priorities in Covid-19 vaccination plan will be carried out by Badan POM in order to ensure a prudent approach as instructed by President Joko Widodo.

"As a government agency responsible for safeguarding the safety of drugs and food, Badan POM is taking strategic measures to ensure the availability of Covid-19 vaccine while prioritizing the public health," Dra. Togi J. Hutadjulu Apt. MHA, Interim Deputy of Drugs, Narcotics, Psychotropic Drugs, Drug Precursors, and Additives at Badan POM.

Badan POM added that the Covid-19 vaccine will be subjected to proper and appropriate research before it is declared ready and safe for the public.

Normally, Badan POM takes strict measures for the approval of vaccine including:

Clinical trials or trials in human to verify its safety, efficacy, and quality;

The quality of product must be ensured through the evaluation of quality;

Vaccine development needs to comply with the Proper Ways of Drugs Development (Cara Pembuatan Obat yang Baik/CPOB).

Clinical Trials as Basis for EUA

Under certain conditions, approval for the vaccine may be in the form of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). EUA is a special registration mechanism during emergencies, such as in the current Covid-19 pandemic in compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. "The decision to grant an Emergency Use Authorization must be made with the consideration that the benefits outweigh the risks," said Togi.

Story continues

Badan POM added that EUA can provide certain flexibility. "So, for example, for safety, we may accept results of the phase one and two clinical trials. Meanwhile, for its efficacy, in addition to obtaining data on the immune system response after vaccination, we may accept the three month interim report data results. Of course, clinical trials are expected to continue while Badan POM continues to provide monitoring," said Togi.

Based on WHO data as of October 19, 2020, 154 vaccine candidates are currently in the preclinical testing phase and 44 Covid-19 vaccine candidates have entered the clinical trial stage. Clinical trials are testing the efficacy of new drugs in humans. Prior to this stage, the drug had gone through preclinical testing through animal testing. Clinical trials are conducted to ensure the effectiveness and safety, as well as to reveal potential side effects in humans.

A number of Covid-19 vaccine candidates have entered the third phase of clinical trials, including those developed by Sinopharm, Sinovac Biotech, AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, Novavax, Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as the Gamaleya Research Institute. "Indonesia is conducting clinical trials for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac. The three month interim results will be completed by the end of the year, and the report will be submitted to Badan POM in early January 2021. This clinical trial has already been conducted in Brazil," Togi explained.

Continuous Monitoring

When the time comes for Covid-19 vaccine distribution, Badan POM will continue to monitor the distribution chain to ensure the quality of the vaccine. "When the vaccination process is rolled out, Badan POM will constantly supervise the vaccine safety through a program of monitoring side effects known as pharmacovigilance," said Togi.

In order for effective monitoring, Badan POM hopes for sound cooperation and participation from all health workers in the field as well as the pharmaceutical industry. According to Togi, health workers may monitor and report the possibility of adverse events following immunization experienced by the community after receiving the vaccine. If there is an increase in the frequency of side effects, Badan POM has the right to review aspects of the efficacy and safety of vaccines. The results of this monitoring are then reviewed by experts.

The government ensures that the distribution approval for vaccines has gone through a series of comprehensive research and tests. By prioritizing the prudent approach, all efforts are made for vaccines to provide the best efficacy for public at large.

About KPCPEN

Based on the consideration that the handling of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and the national economy recovery must be aligned in one integrated and inseparable strategic policy, President Joko Widodo issued Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 82 of 2020 on the Covid-19 Handling and National Economic Recovery Committee (KPCPEN) signed on July 20 2020.

The KPCPEN priorities respectively are INDONESIA SEHAT (Priority for people to be safe from Covid-19 and reforming health services), INDONESIA BEKERJA (Priority for empowerment and acceleration of employment), INDONESIA TUMBUH (Priority for national economy recovery and transformation).

Merck to Acquire OncoImmuneKENILWORTH, N.J., & ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)---- $MRK #COVID19--Merck to Acquire OncoImmuneKENILWORTH, N.J., & ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and OncoImmune, a privately-held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all outstanding shares of OncoImmune for an upfront payment of $425 million in cash. In addition, OncoImmune shareholders will be eligible to receive sales-based payments and payments contingent on the successful achievement of certain regulatory milestones. OncoImmune recently announced positive top-line findings from an interim efficacy analysis of a Phase 3 study evaluating its lead therapeutic candidate CD24Fc for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19.

“ Meaningful new therapeutic options are desperately needed for possibly millions of people around the world who will develop severe or critical COVID-19 disease,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, President Merck Research Laboratories. “ Recent clinical investigations support the view that CD24Fc may provide benefit beyond standard of care therapy for COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen support, and hence will represent an important addition to the Merck pipeline of investigational medicines and vaccines designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Interim analysis of data from 203 participants (75% of the planned enrollment) reported by OncoImmune indicated that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 treated with a single dose of CD24Fc showed a 60% higher probability of improvement in clinical status, as defined by the protocol, compared to placebo. The risk of death or respiratory failure was reduced by more than 50%. Detailed results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

“ Outstanding work by the OncoImmune team has provided compelling evidence regarding the use of CD24Fc in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 in our Phase 3 Trial,” said Yang Liu, PhD, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of OncoImmune. “ We look forward to working with the scientists and manufacturing engineers at Merck as well as regulators as we seek to accelerate the global development of this potentially important therapy.”

Under the agreement, prior to the completion of the acquisition, OncoImmune will spin-out certain rights and assets unrelated to the CD24Fc program to a new entity to be owned by the existing shareholders of OncoImmune. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Merck will invest $50 million, and become a minority shareholder, in the new entity.

The closing of the acquisition, which is subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions, is expected before the end of 2020.

OncoImmune was represented by Goodwin Procter LLP as legal advisor and Guggenheim Securities as financial advisor.

About SAC-COVID Phase 3 Trial

The SAC-COVID Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04317040) is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD24Fc in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen support, including those requiring supplemental oxygen, high flow oxygen, and mechanical ventilation. Participants were randomly assigned into two arms receiving either standard of care plus a single dose of CD24Fc via an intravenous infusion on Day 1 or standard of care plus placebo on Day 1. The multi-center trial was initiated in April 2020 and had enrolled 243 patients when the trial was closed to enrollment in September 2020.

About CD24Fc

OncoImmune’s lead product is CD24Fc, a first-in-class recombinant fusion protein that targets the innate immune system.

Comprehensive safety testing of COVID-19 vaccines based on experience with prior vaccines'The urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines must be balanced with the imperative of ensuring safety and public confidence in vaccines by following the established clinical safety testing protocols throughout vaccine development, including both pre- and post-deploy…"The urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines must be balanced with the imperative of ensuring safety and public confidence in vaccines by following the established clinical safety testing protocols throughout vaccine development, including both pre- and post-deployment," write David M. Knipe and colleagues in this Perspective. The authors highlight how historical experience with vaccine development has paved the way for a well-developed path for preclinical and clinical testing to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy. COVID19 vaccines will be safe if regulatory agencies maintain their well-documented safety testing protocols, as informed by history, they say. As part of this process, all batches of vaccines must be tested for safety. Also, it is critical for developers to understand a vaccine's mechanism of action and immune correlates of protection; understanding these can ensure that vaccines induce the optimal immune response for protection while avoiding nonproductive or counterproductive immune responses. Another lesson learned from historical vaccine development, Knipe and colleagues write, is that if serious adverse events are detected in a clinical trial, then additional clinical testing is indicated. Current regulatory practices require monitoring of rare adverse events pre- and post-licensure of a vaccine, with detection of serious adverse events triggering a pause to trial or use. Indeed, Knipe et al. note, such safety pauses have occurred in current COVID-19 vaccine trials, underscoring the value of extensive regulatory safety protocols, which should not be rushed or undermined. "There is an urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines and exciting progress to that end," write Knipe et al., "but there remains a critical public health obligation to conduct rigorous evaluation to ensure safety as well as efficacy."

Also Read - Explained | Can India Afford Another Lockdown?

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel attended the meeting. Home Minister Amit Shah was also present.

The meeting comes a day after the Supreme Court noted that the COVID-19 situation is likely to worsen in December and all states have to be ready to combat it.

“We are of the view that the immediate steps are required to be taken by all the States as well as by the Union of India. Let status report, as indicated, be filed within two days from today and the matter be listed on November 27, 2020 for consideration and passing appropriate orders”, the top court had said.

Here’s what the chief ministers said:

Delhi: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal informed PM Modi that Delhi saw a peak of 8600 COVID19 cases on 10 November in the third peak. Since then cases and positivity rate are steadily decreasing. The high severity of the third wave is due to many factors including pollution: Delhi Chief Minister’s Office said.

CM Kejriwal also sought PM’s intervention to get rid of pollution due to stubble burning from adjoining states especially given recent bio decomposers. He also asked for the reservation of additional 1000 ICU beds in central govt hospitals till the third wave lasts.

Maharashtra: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray informed PM Narendra Modi that he is in constant touch with Adar Poonawalla of Serum Institute of India (SII) and that the state has formed a task force to ensure timely distribution of vaccine and executing the vaccination programme.

West Bengal: We are ready to work with Central and all other stakeholders to ensure speedy and universal vaccination for everyone as soon as the vaccine is available, said CM Mamata Banerjee.

What PM said?

PM Modi asserted that India is in a better situation than other countries when it comes to recovery and fatality rates.

“Seeing good recovery rates, many think the virus is weak and they’ll recover soon, this has led to rampant carelessness. Those working on vaccines are doing it but we need to focus on ensuring that people are alert & transmission is curbed. We’ve to bring positivity rate under 5%”, he said.

On vaccines, he said that the government of India is keeping a track of each development in vaccine development. “We are in touch with Indian vaccine developers and manufacturers. We are also in touch with global regulators, governments of other countries, multinational orgs & international companies”, PM added.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Karnataka Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that PM wants India to be ready to implement the vaccination on a priority basis in different sectors. Priority sectors are health workers, people above 50 years and persons with comorbid conditions. PM has given clear directions on it

Haryana CM said, “We have been told to make a strategy to make the vaccine available to the general public. As it is not possible to give vaccines to all at once. In the first phase, the vaccine will be provided to health care personnel and people who need it the most.”

“In the second phase vaccine will be given to essential service providers and then there will two phases in which there will be age-wise distribution”, he added.From Lockdown to Vaccine Distribution, Third Wave of COVID to Pollution Crisis: What CMs Discussed During Mee - India.com<ol><li>From Lockdown to Vaccine Distribution, Third Wave of COVID to Pollution Crisis: What CMs Discussed During Mee  India.com

Biomimetic Nanomaterial Strategies for Virus Targeting: Antiviral Therapies and VaccinesBiomimetic nanomaterials have excellent potential to combat viral infections and lay the groundwork for next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines. There is ongoing progress to develop nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, virus‐binding na…The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic highlights the importance of developing effective virus targeting strategies to treat and prevent viral infections. Since virus particles are nanoscale entities, nanomaterial design strategies are ideally suited to create advanced materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles. In this progress report, the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials are critically discussed for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Particular focus is placed on nanomaterial design concepts and material innovations that can be readily developed to thwart future viral threats. Pertinent nanomaterial examples from the COVID‐19 situation are also covered along with discussion of human clinical trial efforts underway that might lead to next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there have been growing calls to recognize that emerging infectious diseases represent a major threat to global health and that we must be better prepared to deal with a future viral pandemic, which could arise from an unknown or understudied virus.[1] In 2018, the World Health Organization expanded on these viewpoints by preparing a list of viral and nonviral pathogens that could cause Disease X, a future human disease outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential that would be triggered by a newly emerged pathogen.[2] In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic arose as the first Disease X and was caused by the global spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has infected over 39 million people and caused over 1 100 000 deaths to date.[3] COVID‐19 is considered by some experts to be a once‐in‐a‐century pandemic[4] and has highlighted how viral pandemics can create a perfect storm of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that is disrupting the institutions of daily life worldwide, including work, healthcare, education, and transportation.[5] Our understanding of COVID‐19 continues to grow since a local outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and led to the discovery of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is related to other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[6] SARS‐CoV‐2 is believed to be a zoonotic virus that crossed over from bats[7] and acquired mutations via natural selection that caused the virus to more efficiently infect human cells and transmit among humans.[8] Early reports of human respiratory disease[9] have since been followed up by numerous, ongoing studies to gain further insight into COVID‐19 disease pathogenesis, including how severe cases of COVID‐19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.[10] Various organs are affected by the disease, including lungs,[11] heart,[12] liver,[13] kidney,[14] and brain.[15] As such, there has been tremendous attention placed on the treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and growing attention to the role that materials science can play in stopping COVID‐19 and, more broadly, the wide range of viral infections affecting global society along with future viral threats.[16] The objective of this progress report is to cover the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Major emphasis is placed on covering the most recent developments mainly within the past three years, while distilling key nanomaterial design principles that can lead to next‐generation advanced materials for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Where applicable, we also discuss how these nanomaterial strategies are being explored to stop SARS‐CoV‐2 along with coverage of relevant human clinical trial efforts.

2 Advanced Materials for Virus Targeting Virus particles (“virions”) are biological nanoparticles that contain viral genetic material and are surrounded by a protein or lipid bilayer membrane coating. The particles are typically around 50–300 nm in diameter and are functionalized with glycoproteins that play an important role in binding to cells.[17] There are two main types: enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Membrane‐enveloped viruses are surrounded by a host‐cell‐derived lipid membrane that contains embedded glycoproteins while nonenveloped viruses have a protein‐based capsid shell without lipid membrane.[18] In both cases, the glycoproteins on the virus particle surface are the major antigens, which are recognized by the host immune system and can elicit an antibody response.[19] Once the immune system is trained to recognize a viral antigen, the immune system can rapidly produce antibodies that bind to the virus particles and prevent them from causing infection.[20] Fundamentally, virus particles are parasites that must infect susceptible cells and highjack cellular machinery in order to produce new virus particles.[21] The basic steps are presented in Scheme 1a. The first step involves virus particle binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface, which can result in cellular entry and start of the infection process. Each type of cell has a characteristic pattern of receptors found on the cellular surface and different viruses bind preferentially to particular ones. For example, many viruses bind specifically to glycan‐functionalized receptors containing sulfonate or sialyl functional groups. Infected cells produce new copies of viral genetic material and viral proteins, which are then assembled in order to produce new virus particles that are released extracellularly and infect new cells. The process continues indefinitely until an organism succumbs to virus‐induced cellular damage and related immune responses, and viruses can also spread between organisms via a wide range of transmission mechanisms. Scheme 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Biomimetic nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. a) Overview of virus life cycle. Viruses cannot replicate independently and must infect cells. The replication machinery of infected cells is highjacked by viruses and used to create new copies of the viral genome and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles that are released from the cell and spread to infect other cells. b) Examples of different nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. i) Nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors can inhibit the production of new virus particles. ii) Virus‐binding nanoparticles and iii) cell membrane decoys can bind to virus particles and prevent viral infection of cells. iv) Viral membrane inhibitors can disrupt membrane‐enveloped virus particles, abrogating infectivity. v) Extracorporeal blood filters can remove circulating virus particles from the bloodstream to reduce disease burden. vi) Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines that mimic the multivalent presentation of antigens on virus particle surfaces can elicit improved immune responses that lead to greater protection against future virus exposure. Depending on the objective, various nanomaterial strategies can be useful to stop viruses, as presented in Scheme 1b. Conventionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to inhibit viral genome replication inside infected cells, thereby preventing the production of new virus particles.[22] Nanomaterial strategies have proven useful to enhance the pharmacological properties of viral genome replication inhibitors, including circulation time. While it is advantageous to stop viral genome replication in order to help treat existing viral infections, there is also extensive interest in exploring how nanomaterials can be useful to prevent viral infections.[23] Virus‐binding nanomaterials can attach to virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells. Pristine nanomaterials can be used along with receptor‐functionalized ones and cell‐membrane‐decoy nanomaterials, which are coated with cell membrane extracts containing natural receptors. Ongoing efforts have also devised nanomaterial‐based strategies to effectively remove extracellular virus particles from infected organisms by either selectively disrupting virus particles or by removing them through extracorporeal filtration strategies. Moreover, some of the most recent and innovative advances have come from developing nanoparticle vaccines, especially self‐assembling protein‐based ones, which have demonstrated excellent potential to prevent multiple types of viral infections.[24] One of the most promising candidates has been rapidly advanced into human clinical trials as a potential universal flu vaccine[25] and similar strategies are now being applied to SARS‐CoV‐2. A key innovative aspect of these nanoparticle vaccines is that critical architectural properties of virus particles, particularly the specific organization of glycoprotein antigens, can now be mimicked with nanoscale precision and these advanced material capabilities have led to nanoparticle vaccine candidates with superior immunizing capabilities to currently used vaccine strategies in some cases. The latest progress in all of these areas is covered in the following sections.

3 Viral Replication Inhibitors The most widely used class of direct‐acting antiviral drugs encompasses small molecules that inhibit the genome replication of viruses inside infected cells.[26] These replication processes involve a multiprotein replication complex called the viral replicase[27] and antiviral therapy often targets one or more types of the viral proteins that form this complex. Key examples of antiviral drugs in this class include nucleoside and nucleotide analogues that inhibit the viral polymerase, which is the main enzyme involved in viral genome production.[28] Over the years, there have been extensive efforts to develop prodrugs[29]—inactive molecules that are metabolized into the active drug in vivo—and drug delivery systems that enable longer circulation time, targeted delivery, and/or improved safety of viral replication inhibitors, in line with broader innovation trends in the nanomedicine field as a whole. Promising examples include development of a once weekly, orally administered antiviral drug delivery platform that consists of several polymer matrices with different drug release profiles in order to consistently maintain pharmaceutically relevant concentrations of antiviral drugs in systemic circulation.[30] One of the most recent examples of cutting‐edge nanomaterial strategies to deliver viral replication inhibitors involves the class of macromolecular prodrugs, comprising polymer‐functionalized antiviral drugs in complexation with serum proteins. Andersen et al. described the formation of polymer–protein–drug complexes that enable long‐duration therapy with multiple antiviral drugs.[31] A polymer–protein complex comprised of a single, ≈7 kDa N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (PHPMA) chain per covalently attached albumin molecule was designed and exhibited much longer circulation half‐time and higher concentrations in mice upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as compared to free PHPMA alone. Marked accumulation of the polymer–protein complex in mouse lymph nodes was also reported. Two antiviral drugs, azidothymidine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), were covalently incorporated into the monomer backbone via a labile disulfide linkage for eventual intracellular release of free drug molecules. These functionalized building blocks were assembled into a colloidal‐like polymer–protein–drug complex consisting of one polymer chain with six AZT and four 3TC copies along with one albumin molecule and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human T cells in vitro. Frich et al. expanded on this macromolecular prodrug strategy by devising a “hitchhiking” scheme in which a polymer–drug conjugate was fabricated and exhibited noncovalent binding to serum albumin proteins, as indicated by biophysical experiments and increased circulation half‐time in mice in vivo.[32] The key innovation was functionalizing the PHPMA component with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) lipid, which is a binding ligand for serum albumin proteins found in circulation (Figure 1a). A polymer–drug conjugate was synthesized consisting of DSPE–PHPMA and multiple copies of acyclovir (ACV), which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpes simplex virus (HSV). It was verified that free ACV could be released from the DSPE–PHPMA–ACV complex upon incubation in physiologically relevant conditions containing glutathione (GSH). It was determined that >100 × 10−9 m ACV was released within 3 h from 1 g L–1 PHPMA–ACV in GSH‐containing phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) while nearly negligible release was observed over an appreciably longer time period of 24 h in PBS without GSH. Importantly, DSPE–PHPMA–ACV also exhibited antiviral activity against HSV type 2 (HSV‐2) infection of baby hamster kidney‐derived ELVIS and human cervix‐derived HeLa cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous administration of the polymer–drug complex helped to suppress vaginal HSV‐2 infection in an in vivo mouse model based on viral infectivity measurements of vaginal wash and spinal cord specimens (Figure 1b).

DSPE‐PHPMA was found to bind noncovalently to serum albumin proteins, which was associated with a longer circulation half‐time in mice. By contrast, PHPMA alone did not bind appreciably to albumins. b) Effect of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered DSPE‐PHPMA‐ACV, PHPMA‐ACV, free ACV, and no treatment (N.t.) on vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2) infection in an in vivo mouse model.

In addition to forming polymer–drug complexes, recent efforts have focused on creating macromolecular prodrugs from chemical derivatives of nucleoside analogues that can form nucleic acid scaffolds. For example, Krüger et al. demonstrated that idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to treat HSV infection, could be converted into a phosphoramidite derivative and then these building blocks were used to synthesize linear nucleic acid scaffolds with 7 or 14 attached drug molecules (Figure 1c).[33] In vitro release experiments revealed that the scaffolds are stable in serum‐free cell culture medium while free idoxuridine was gradually released within 2–6 h in the presence of serum, indicating the potential utility of these scaffolds for in vivo applications (Figure 1d). Future work needs to continue exploring the prophylactic and therapeutic utility of macromolecular prodrugs of viral replication inhibitors in animal models, while there exist numerous potential advantages in terms of well‐defined colloidal properties and targeted codelivery of two or more antiviral drugs to increase the barrier for drug‐resistant virus strains to emerge.[34] There also remains an outstanding need to investigate the mechanisms of drug release in vivo and to also continue exploring how macromolecular prodrugs can be engineered to target specific organs.

4 Virus Particle Binding Inhibitors 4.1 Pristine Nanomaterials Over the years, various classes of nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based nanomaterials have been synthesized and there are well‐developed methods to control atomic composition, size, and functional groups. Accordingly, systematic studies have long been conducted to test how different types of pristine nanomaterials—as‐synthesized nanomaterials without additional surface functionalization—affect virus particles and have revealed a variety of antiviral mechanisms related to virus particle binding and steric blocking, chemical reactions involving nanomaterial‐induced reactive species, and virus particle disruption, as extensively covered in numerous reviews.[35] To date, however, most of these antiviral activities have been characterized in vitro, while it is more challenging to use pristine nanomaterials in vivo where they can show diminished antiviral activity. Key challenges include nonspecific binding of nanomaterials to other biological components and the protein corona that can form spontaneously on nanomaterial surfaces upon immersion in physiological environments.[36] In addition to conventional nanomaterial options, there has also been extensive interest in designing nanomaterials from poorly soluble antimicrobial compounds, which can improve solubility and potential usability in some cases. For example, Huang et al. reported the fabrication of water‐dispersible, benzoxazine monomer‐derived carbon dots with ≈4 nm diameter, which inhibited a wide range of viruses, including Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and Dengue (Figure 2a).[37] Significant reductions in viral infectivity in vitro against baby hamster kidney‐derived BHK‐21 and monkey kidney‐derived Vero cells were observed upon pretreatment of virus particles with the carbon dots (Figure 2b,c). Another study involved the fabrication of water‐dispersible, glycyrrhizic acid‐derived carbon dots that inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of nonhuman primate‐derived MARC‐145, Vero, and pig kidney‐derived PK‐15 cells by suppressing viral genome replication and stimulating innate immune responses.[38] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint –1 BZM‐CDs.

Taking inspiration from how a wide range of biological materials have spiky surfaces for increased adhesion, one of the most recent advances has been the development of spiky nanostructures that have improved contact with virus particles (Figure 2d). Based on the complex topology of spherical influenza virus particles, including the presence of protruding glycoproteins, Nie et al. fabricated spiky silica nanoparticles that exhibited improved adhesion to the virus particles, as compared to smooth silica nanoparticles (Figure 2e).[39] The spike dimensions were optimized so that the nanoparticle spikes could fit well in between the glycoprotein protrusions (Figure 2f,g). Notably, however, the spiky silica nanoparticles had low aqueous dispersibility, so they were initially coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) but did not inhibit influenza virus infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK‐II cells in vitro. Therefore, the spiky silica nanoparticles were coated with a red blood cell membrane extract, which facilitated antiviral activity in vitro, as indicated by reduced virus particle binding to cells and decreased viral infectivity. Cell membrane coatings are further discussed in Section 4.3 below and this example provides insight into how the biological functionality of nanomaterials can be modulated based on the surface coating. A combination of binding ligands and antiviral drugs was further conjugated on the spiky nanoparticle surface to enhance antiviral activity against influenza virus and inhibit infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro.[40] Porous gold nanoparticles with a high surface area have also been reported to inhibit infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK cells by a wide range of influenza virus strains in vitro.[41] Ultimately, such studies have provided insight into how nanoparticle composition and shape can influence antiviral activity and this research direction has been greatly enhanced in recent years by integrating nanomaterial design together with biomimetic surface functionalization with cell‐mimicking receptors and cell membrane extracts. 4.2 Receptor‐Functionalized Nanomaterials 4.2.1 Sulfonated Nanoparticles Virus particle attachment to cell membrane receptors is a critical first step in the infection process and, for many types of viruses, involves viral protein binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors that are present on cell surfaces.[42] As such, stopping these virus‐cell binding interactions via competitive inhibitors can prevent infection and various classes of sulfonated polysaccharides have been explored, including heparin[43] and heparin‐like molecules[44] along with metal complexes of sulfonated molecules, and exhibit antiviral activity in vitro.[45] Many of these antiviral molecules have been explored as topical microbicides to prevent vaginal transmission of viruses such as HIV, however, none have demonstrated efficacy in late‐stage clinical trials and intracorporeal efficacy is more challenging to achieve.[46] In light of these shortcomings and the potential utility of this biomimetic design concept in principle, there has been extensive interest in developing sulfonated nanoparticles with a well‐controlled, multivalent presentation of sulfonate groups to inhibit susceptible viruses. Baram‐Pinto et al. reported that sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection of Vero cells in vitro by preventing cell entry of virus particles and hence reducing cell‐to‐cell spreading as well.[47] Notably, the sulfonate groups in that study were attached to gold nanoparticles via short‐chain linkers with low conformational flexibility. Cagno et al. further investigated the design of sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles with short‐chain, low‐flexibility and long‐chain, high‐flexibility linkers and discovered that the use of more flexible chains enabled improved antiviral activity in vitro with Vero cells, ex vivo with human epivaginal tissue cultures, and in vivo in mice (Figure 3a).[48] While both types of sulfonate‐functionalized nanoparticles could bind to and inhibit viruses such as HSV‐2, only the nanoparticles with flexible linkers could inhibit viruses upon dilution due to stronger binding interactions and heparin was also inactive (Figure 3b–d). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that nanoparticle‐virus particle interactions in the latter case resulted in virus particle disruption, indicating a virucidal (“virus‐killing”) type of mechanism (Figure 3e–g). Intranasal administration of the sulfonated nanoparticles also prophylactically inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice in vivo.

Sulfonate‐functionalized inorganic nanoparticles as virucidal inhibitors to disrupt virus particles. a) Schematic illustration of nanoparticle strategies to inhibit virus particles that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on cellular surfaces during the infection process. The basic concept is to create biomimetic nanoparticles with sulfonate groups that can tightly bind to virus particles to prevent virus binding to HSPG cell receptors. Top row: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with low‐flexibility 3‐mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES), termed MES‐AuNPs, can bind relatively weakly to virus particles to prevent infection. However, the inhibitory effect of MES‐AuNPs is lost upon dilution and the virus particles remain infective. Bottom: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with high‐flexibility undecanesulfonic acid (MUS), termed MUS‐AuNPs, can bind relatively strongly to virus particles and prevent infection.

Building on this work, Zacheo et al. recently explored how controlling the properties of the sulfonated ligands on the gold nanoparticle surface affects the degree of antiviral activity and identified glucose‐ and lactose‐based ligands with virucidal activity against Dengue virus to inhibit infection of Vero and human liver‐derived HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro.[49] Dey et al. have also reported the fabrication of ≈100–200 nm diameter, hydrogel‐like sulfonated nanogel particles and demonstrated that the nanogels can block HSV‐1 infection of monkey kidney‐derived Vero E6 cells in vitro.[50] Importantly, several types of nanogels were designed with different degrees of flexibility and more flexible nanogels showed greater antiviral activity. Cyclodextrin scaffolds functionalized with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids have also exhibited broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against numerous medically important viruses and further testing showed that HSV did not acquire resistance to the sulfonated cyclodextrin scaffolds.[51] The in vitro antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of money kidney‐derived Vero‐CCL81 and Vero E6 cells has been described in at least two recent works,[52] supporting that nanomaterial strategies involving sulfonate groups might be effective antiviral strategies to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 as well. 4.2.2 Sialylated Nanoparticles Different viruses bind to specific types of cell surface receptors as part of the infection process and another key example involves the influenza virus, which is a leading cause of respiratory viral infections.[53] Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins on the influenza virus particle surface bind to sialic acid‐containing glycan molecules that are prevalent on the surface of human lung cells as well as those of different animal species.[54] As with sulfonate‐related binding interactions and protein–glycan interactions in general, individual events of viral protein binding to sialic acids are relatively weak and strong interactions depend on multivalency.[55] Accordingly, a wide range of nanomaterial scaffolds with multiple sialic acid residues have been designed to competitively bind to influenza virus particles and thus prevent viral infection. Recent efforts have focused on how precisely tuning the distance between sialic acid residues on the scaffold affects HA binding. For example, Bandlow et al. investigated how rigid scaffolds composed of self‐assembled complexes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) enhanced binding interactions compared to more flexible, polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.[56] This finding agreed well with antiviral testing data on rigid and flexible core trivalent sialosides too.[57] Another important design variable has been considering linear versus branched scaffolds.[58] In one promising example, Kwon et al. reported the fabrication of a branched polyamidoamine scaffold that mirrored the inter‐spacing distance between HA proteins on influenza virus particles and intranasal administration of this scaffold was able to protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection.[59] Other recent examples include more sophisticated nanomaterial designs involving three‐way nucleic acid junctions[60] and star glycopolymers.[61] In addition to polymer‐like scaffolds, there has been ongoing exploration of sialic‐functionalized nanoparticles and a key example involves bacteriophage capsid nanoparticles with well‐controlled spacing of sialic acid‐functionalized ligands (Figure 4a,b).[62] Capsid nanoparticles with the correct Sia1 sialic acid ligands could specifically bind to influenza virus particles while nanoparticles functionalized with other glycan ligands did not bind to virus particles (Figure 4c,d). Likewise, only Sia1‐functionalized nanoparticles could inhibit influenza virus infection of MDCK‐II and human lung‐derived A549 cells in vitro in a dose‐dependent fashion and influenza virus pretreatment with the nanoparticles also protected mice from infection‐related weight loss in vivo (Figure 4e,f).

Richard et al. have also systematically investigated how sialic acid‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can be designed in terms of core nanoparticle size and linker length and unraveled how these parameters influence multivalent binding interactions, which can give rise to highly specific binding to particular ligand geometries.[63] In terms of soft‐matter nanoparticles, Bhatia et al. have also investigated the design of ≈250 nm diameter sialylated nanogel particles with varying degrees of flexibility and observed that highly flexible nanogel particles inhibited cell attachment of influenza virus by up to 400 times, as compared to more rigid nanogel particles.[64] The flexible nanogel particles also prevented influenza infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro down to picomolar concentrations. In another interesting example, Kong et al. reported the development of sialic acid‐functionalized lipid nanodisks that can bind to and cause perforation of influenza virus particles.[65] This example demonstrated that sialic acid‐functionalized nanoparticles can exhibit additional mechanistic functions beyond inhibiting virus‐cell interactions only and intravenous administration of the nanodisks also protected mice against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. In addition to new nanoparticle designs, there has been extensive recent progress in developing nanoscience measurement tools to quantify influenza viral protein‐sialic acid binding interactions. For example, single‐molecule force spectroscopy experiments have been conducted to comparatively measure the binding strength of influenza HA and neuraminidase proteins to sialic acid receptors[66] and the effects of multivalency on such interactions.[67] Di Iorio et al. have also fabricated sialic acid‐functionalized lipid bilayers and measured the binding of ≈22 nm diameter clusters of recombinant influenza HA proteins to supported lipid bilayers by quartz crystal microbalance‐dissipation (QCM‐D) experiments.[68] Other techniques such as microcavity arrays can also measure the diffusional motion of HA proteins bound to sialic acid‐functionalized supported lipid bilayers.[69] To date, most of these measurement strategies have been employed for understanding the fundamental role of multivalency in viral protein–glycan interactions while there remains tremendous potential to utilize these approaches for evaluating the functional performance of new nanomaterial inhibitors as well as to test drug inhibitor candidates that prevent such interactions.[70] 4.2.3 Additional Strategies In addition to glycan‐based decoy binding strategies for competitive inhibition, nucleic acid nanostructures have enabled creative design possibilities based on self‐assembling, complex topologies. For example, Kwon et al. reported the design of 3D DNA nanostructures with highly precise architectural features and incorporated Dengue viral protein‐binding aptamers within the nanostructure, which could bind multivalently to Dengue virus particles.[71] Different nanostructures such as heptagons, hexagons, and stars were tested and it was discovered that the star nanostructure yielded the most potent inhibitory activity to prevent Dengue virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to inhibit Dengue virus was around 2 × 10−9 m for star nanostructures, as compared to 10 × 10−9 and 440 × 10−9 m for the hexagon and heptagon nanostructures, respectively. This example provides an important demonstration of how synthetic receptors can be engineered in the future to develop more potent nanomaterial options, especially from natural, biocompatible materials, and with self‐assembling properties. These synthetic capabilities have also inspired current efforts to develop nanomaterial inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 based on understanding what receptor the virus binds and how to design receptor‐mimicking decoys. Specifically, the latest scientific evidence supports that SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the membrane‐associated angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell surfaces as part of the infection process.[72] Han et al. have reported the computational design of peptides that correspond to structurally important regions of ACE2 and can bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins to prevent infection.[73] It was suggested that the inhibitory peptides could be attached to nanoparticles with multivalent presentation, while such design strategies would require a careful consideration of how to best optimize the peptide attachment in terms of attachment chemistry, flexibility, density, and peptide conformation. There is also interest in engineering the ACE2 protein to bind more strongly to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins[74] and experimental work to test antiviral peptide inhibitors in this direction is ongoing. 4.3 Cell Membrane Decoys Over the past decade, there has been extensive and rapidly growing interest in coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane extracts to confer advantageous biological properties. For example, Hu et al. demonstrated that coating polymeric nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes can increase circulation time in mice.[75] It has also been demonstrated that cloaking polymeric nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of human platelets can improve immunocompatibility in terms of lower macrophage uptake and reduced complement activation, along with additional platelet‐like functionalities.[76] Ongoing progress in the field has also sparked interest in developing cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles that contain virus‐binding receptors and hence can bind to virus particles in order to prevent infection.[77] Numerous viruses such as Dengue and Zika are transmitted by mosquito vectors[78] and Rao et al. demonstrated that gelatin nanoparticles coated with mosquito cell membrane extracts can bind to Zika virus particles, whereby each ≈130 nm diameter nanoparticle binds to multiple virus particles.[79] This approach led to dose‐dependent reduction in viral infectivity of Vero cells in vitro and intravenous administration of the coated nanoparticles up to 2 days postinoculation also protected mice against virus‐induced mortality and body weight loss and reduced the level of viral infection in the brain. Red blood cell membrane‐coated magnetic nanoparticles with sialylated functional groups have also been employed to capture influenza virus particles.[80] In addition to using natural cell membrane extracts that contain typical amounts of virus‐binding receptors, there have been attempts to engineer cells to overexpress those receptors and to prepare cell‐derived membrane vesicles accordingly. For example, Liu et al. devised a biosynthetic strategy to overexpress the membrane receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is called human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), in HepG2 cells and prepared ≈200 nm diameter, cell membrane‐derived vesicles that were used to inhibit HBV infection of HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro and in mice with humanized livers in vivo (Figure 5a).[81] Compared to control membrane vesicles from the parent cell line with normal receptor quantities, the membrane vesicles from the engineered cell line with an overexpressed quantity of receptors exhibited appreciably greater antiviral activity levels and demonstrated improved treatment efficacy in the mouse model, as indicated by lower levels of HBV antibodies and nucleic acid copies (Figure 5b,c). Recently, Rao et al. reported the fabrication of cell membrane‐derived vesicles from human monocyte cells that were genetically engineered to express the ACE2 receptor and the ACE2‐functionalized vesicles could prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro.[82] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint [ 81 ] Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH. d) Strategy to capture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus particles by using cell‐membrane‐coated polymeric nanoparticles termed nanosponges (NS).

Similar approaches have also been taken to treat and prevent infection by HIV, which is known to infect T cells.[83] Polymeric nanoparticles were coated with the plasma membranes of CD4+ T cells, which contain the receptors needed for virus binding and cell entry, and the cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human‐monocyte‐derived macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, it was suggested that this cell membrane decoy strategy could be potentially advantageous to work against multiple, genetically diverse HIV strains because all strains bind to the same cell receptors.[85] A follow‐up study confirmed that the T cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit a wide range of HIV‐1 strains and surprisingly induced autophagy of HIV‐infected cells to suppress viral genome replication but had no effect on uninfected cells.[86] Recently, cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles have also been developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro (Figure 5d).[84] Nanoparticles coated with extracts from human lung epithelial type II or macrophage cells inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent fashion while nanoparticles coated with extracts from red blood cells were inactive (Figure 5e). These findings emphasize the importance of rationally designing biomimetic nanomaterial strategies based on a precise understanding of how a certain virus affects cells, and further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of these inhibitory capabilities in vivo.

5 Viral Membrane Inhibitors Most nanomaterial‐based antiviral strategies focus on targeting viral protein components in order to prevent virus‐cell binding interactions as described in the preceding examples. However, various types of viruses use distinct binding receptors to enter cells and such strategies are therefore intrinsically limited to working against a relatively narrow subset of viruses. On the other hand, many viral epidemics are caused by membrane‐enveloped viruses and a structurally intact viral membrane on enveloped viruses is necessary for viral infectivity, including virus‐cell fusion.[87] As such, a wide range of broad‐spectrum antiviral drug candidates have been explored to inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses based on targeting the viral membrane.[87] One of the most exciting groups of drug candidates within this class are membrane‐disruptive, antiviral peptides that inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses in order to abrogate viral infectivity.[88] Several antiviral peptides have been discovered that inhibit a wide range of membrane‐enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)[89] and HIV,[90] and include a 27‐mer amphipathic, α‐helical (AH) peptide that exhibits membrane‐curvature‐selective disruptive activity to inhibit small, membrane‐enveloped virus particles of ≈160 nm diameter or smaller.[91] In vitro antiviral testing experiments against various types of membrane‐enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have been conducted using a wide range of permissive, model cell lines such as Vero cells and human liver‐derived Huh 7.5 cells as well as primary cells such as mouse neuronal cells and human T cells. The results have demonstrated that some membrane‐active peptides exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses down to the nanomolar range along with low cell cytotoxicity.[92] While viral envelopes are derived from host cell membranes, the AH peptide and possibly other peptides can exhibit selective rupture of highly curved viral membranes due to membrane‐curvature‐triggered membrane disruption.[93] Indeed, mammalian cells are much larger than virus particles and hence possess an appreciably lower degree of membrane curvature and this curvature difference provides a distinguishing factor between viral and mammalian cell membranes.[94] These promising mechanistic features have motivated researchers to explore how to utilize viral‐membrane‐targeting, antiviral peptides in vivo, while exploring design strategies to overcome traditional challenges of peptide therapeutics, such as high susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and short circulation time.[95] To overcome these challenges, Jackman et al. explored the development of an engineered version of the AH peptide, composed of all D‐amino acids and termed AH‐D, which was able to therapeutically treat lethal Zika virus infection in a mouse model in vivo.[92] The basic design concept was called lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD) and posited that extracellular targeting of membrane‐enveloped viruses can reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in order to help curb viral infection (Figure 6a). Upon intravenous administration of the AH‐D peptide starting 3 days post‐virus inoculation, over 80% of mice survived Zika virus infection and exhibited markedly reduced clinical symptoms in general. Importantly, the AH‐D peptide was able to significantly reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in the blood as well as in multiple organs, including in the brain (Figure 6b). More extensive studies revealed that the AH‐D peptide is able to cross the intact blood‐brain barrier to treat Zika virus infection directly in the brain as well as to reduce infection‐related brain inflammation (Figure 6c,d).

From a material science perspective, another noteworthy point is that a large portion of the mechanistic understanding about how AH and AH‐D peptides work has been obtained from biosensing measurement strategies involving biomimetic, virus‐particle‐mimicking vesicles in combination with acoustic‐, optical‐, nanoplasmonic‐, and fluorescence‐microscopy‐based techniques.[91, 96] Examples include nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and plasmonic nanohole sensors[97] (Figure 6e–i). Such insights have led to further exploration of the AH‐D peptide as an antiviral drug candidate to prevent Zika virus infection of fetuses in pregnant mice[98] and forward‐looking discussion about how the LEAD concept could be useful for broadly treating mosquito‐borne virus infections, including not only Zika but also Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever among various possibilities.[99] This capability could be especially beneficial when a mosquito‐borne viral infection is clinically suspected but a differential diagnosis of the specific virus type is challenging.[100] The LEAD concept might be generally applicable to other types of membrane‐enveloped viruses as well since the viral membrane represents an Achilles heel and there is a high barrier to the emergence of drug‐resistant strains because the viral membrane is derived from host cell membranes and not encoded within the viral genome.[101] It has even been suggested that membrane‐enveloped SARS‐CoV‐2 might be susceptible to viral membrane disruption[102] and these aspects are particularly important because SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the brain has been linked to a wide range of COVID‐19 disease conditions.[103] While intravenously administered, antiviral peptides have demonstrated initial promise in some mouse models of viral infections, nanomaterial‐based drug delivery strategies could improve pharmacological activities and lead to improved targeting possibilities. Zhang et al. have reported the development of a cationic, membrane‐active antiviral peptide that was mixed together with anionic polymer chains to form ≈35 nm diameter nanoparticles.[104] These peptide‐polymer nanoparticles exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against HCV infection of Huh 7.5 cells and HIV infection of TZM‐bl cells, human lymphocytes, and monocyte‐derived macrophages, respectively, and also showed lower levels of hemolytic activity against red blood cells than the free peptide alone. Intramuscular injection of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles showed improved treatment of HIV‐1 infection in a mouse model in vivo, as compared to free peptide alone. In a follow‐up study, a refined version of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles was developed that was functionalized with galactosyl sugar molecules in order to enable improved HepG2 cell internalization in vitro and preferential liver accumulation in mice in vivo.[105] Ongoing work can further expand the potential of targeting membrane‐enveloped viruses by using antiviral peptides and other classes of small‐molecule inhibitors[106] that impair viral membrane‐associated proteins to prevent virus‐cell fusion in combination with nanomaterial strategies to enhance targeted delivery prospects. In addition to directly targeting virus particles, it might be possible to also disrupt membrane‐enveloped exosomes that carry viral components such as nucleic acids and proteins and can be involved in viral infection and transmission processes.[107]

6 Virus‐Removing Blood Filters Another approach to effectively remove circulating virus particles from the blood of infected hosts has relied on the use of extracorporeal blood‐filtering devices and advances upon medical device technology that was originally used to treat sepsis infections.[108] Early work by Kang et al. demonstrated that a microfluidic device can effectively remove a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood.[109] To achieve this objective, ≈130 nm diameter magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) protein molecules, which can bind to sugar molecules found on the surface of various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses along with endotoxins.[110] The MBL‐functionalized nanoparticles were mixed together with circulating blood, could bind to circulating pathogens, and then the nanoparticle‐pathogen mixtures could be magnetically separated before the blood was returned to the host. In rat models of bacterial infection, more than 90% of bacteria were reduced along with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Seiler et al. have further explored the use of an engineered version of MBL that demonstrated improved pathogen capture in blood and urine samples.[111] Based on these findings, there has been ongoing progress to develop extracorporeal blood filters for virus particle removal applications as well. Tullis et al. demonstrated that hemodialysis treatment using a hollow‐fiber cartridge that contained antibody‐functionalized agarose beads could effectively remove HIV‐1 virus particles and viral proteins from cell culture media and blood.[112] These capabilities have led to the exploration of clinical‐stage medical device technology to broadly capture a wide range of circulating virus particles by replacing the antibody functionalization with MBL functionalization. Early reports indicated preliminary testing success to capture HIV and HCV virus particles along with binding to Dengue, influenza, Ebola, and Marburg viral proteins.[113] A pilot human clinical trial using a full‐scale version of this medical device technology was used to remove HCV from the blood of 4 HCV‐positive patients and resulted in an average drop in HCV viral loads of around 57%.[114] Follow‐up studies showed HCV viral load reductions in additional patients and it was further suggested that continuous application of this treatment approach could potentially reduce HCV to clinically undetectable levels within a few days, especially if used in combination with conventional antiviral drug therapies.[115] Büttner et al. have also reported that the medical device technology has been used to treat one patient with Ebola virus infection[116] and recent works have explored how these extracorporeal blood filters might be useful to remove coronaviruses and Marburg virus from infected blood.[117] With respect to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it has also been noted that virus‐removing blood filters could be a useful technology.[118] Given the small number of patients in the aforementioned clinical testing, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present stage, however, there are bright prospects to continue exploring virus‐removing blood filter technology. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the initiation of a feasibility study, with up to 40 human patients, to test the treatment efficacy of an extracorporeal blood filter based on this medical device technology for patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis and severe COVID‐19 disease.[119] In terms of future innovation in this direction, it is important to continue exploring how to develop improved filtration devices while also creating new biofunctionalization strategies to improve virus‐binding capacity and perhaps apply peptide functionalization schemes to catalytically damage virus particles as opposed to intact virus particle binding alone. Looking forward, these medical device technologies can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antiviral drug therapies to lower the amount of infectious virus particles in blood while also inhibiting the production of new virus particles among other possibilities.

7 Virus‐Mimicking Nanoparticle Vaccines 7.1 Design Rationale There has also been tremendous progress in developing nanoparticle‐based vaccine strategies to prevent and treat viral infections. In general, viral infections provoke the immune system, which can recognize viral proteins on the virus particle surface (“antigens”) and produce antibodies that bind to these antigens to neutralize virus particles.[120] In some cases, natural antibodies produced in response to a viral infection can have extremely high specificity and potency to inhibit virus particles.[121] For these reasons, the blood plasma from patients who recover from a certain type of virus infection is often given as a medical treatment to infected patients afflicted with the same type of virus infection.[122] In such cases, the plasma can contain high levels of neutralizing antibodies that bind to and inhibit virus particles.[123] However, the specific types and concentrations of antibodies present in blood plasma vary from person‐to‐person, potentially limiting reliable clinical use.[124] Hence, there has been extensive interest in recombinantly manufacturing specific, highly potent neutralizing antibodies as an alternative treatment option.[125] This latter approach allows more precise control over antibody composition and dosing. Recombinant antibody therapies also reduce the risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, which can arise in some cases from non‐neutralizing antibodies that are also present in plasma.[125, 126] The same logic applies to vaccine development where the key objective is to administer a virus‐mimicking immunogenic material so that a strong and focused immune response can be trained. The target objective is to generate high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies while minimizing production of non‐neutralizing antibodies that can otherwise inadvertently promote virus infection in some cases. Over the past few years, virus‐mimicking nanomaterial design strategies have been at the forefront of creating next‐generation vaccine strategies now reaching human clinical trials. The combination of nanomaterials, biomimetics, and protein engineering has led to unprecedented capabilities to rationally finetune immune responses and elicit high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies in a safe and effective manner. These capabilities are currently being extended to develop a nanoparticle vaccine candidate to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Recent progress in the field highlights the merits of both natural and engineered protein scaffolds to create self‐assembling, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines with excellent biomechanical and immunological properties. The fast‐moving progress on this subject is reviewed in this section along with coverage of other vaccine nanoparticle strategies. 7.2 Types of Nanoparticle Vaccines There is broad interest in integrating material science and protein engineering strategies to develop safe, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines that present viral protein antigens in a highly organized and symmetrical manner in order to induce strong immune responses.[127] Compared to free antigens, nanoparticle vaccines have several compelling advantages, including greater antigen stability, multivalent presentation of antigens, and targeted delivery.[128] As such, nanoparticle vaccines can bind multivalently to multiple receptors on B cells, which are immune cells involved in antibody production, resulting in more robust immune responses and high levels of immune protection.[24] A wide variety of nanoparticle types are being explored to prevent infectious diseases in general, including self‐assembling protein nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomal nanoparticles, and polymer scaffolds.[129] Key design considerations include optimizing the antigen structure (more precisely, the immunogen structure) to elicit the desired immune response, tuning vaccine delivery, and inducing focused immune responses.[130] From a biomimetic perspective, one of the most promising recent design advances has involved self‐assembled nanoparticle vaccines as discussed below along with introducing other nanoparticle vaccine design strategies. 7.2.1 Natural Protein Scaffolds The earliest example of a natural protein scaffold to form a nanoparticle vaccine involved the use of ferritin, which self‐assembles into nearly spherical, hollow nanoparticles that have ≈12 nm core diameter and are composed of 24 protein molecules with symmetrical organization.[131] By overcoming several challenges related to protein glycosylation and oligomerization, Kanekiyo et al. first reported the design of a ferritin‐based, influenza nanoparticle vaccine in 2013 that presented eight trimers of influenza HA viral protein on the nanoparticle surface in a native‐like configuration that enabled a superior immune response to conventionally used influenza vaccine strategies based on inactivated virus particles.[132] From a material science perspective, the key innovation was controlling the location at which ferritin and HA were genetically fused together in order to recombinantly express ferritin‐HA fusion proteins that self‐assembled into nanoparticles with repetitively spaced, trimeric HA spikes (Figure 7a,b). Ferritin‐HA nanoparticle immunization induced a strong immune response, as indicated by high levels of neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza H1N1 strains and protection against influenza virus infection in a ferret model (Figure 7c,d). Recently, Kelly et al. have elucidated how ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccination in mice triggers principally germinal center expansion and maturation of memory B cells, which are involved in antibody production.[133] In another study, Yassine et al. further explored the development of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines that presented a truncated version of HA, which corresponded to the stem region that is conserved across different HA subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and hence its trimeric presentation on the nanoparticle surface conferred protection against a wider range of influenza subtypes in mouse and ferret models.[134] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ).

Ferritin nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed to prevent infections from viruses such as HIV‐1 and Sliepen et al. first reported the design of ferritin nanoparticles presenting HIV‐1 envelope (Env) protein trimers, which demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity in mice and rabbits.[136] Neutralizing antibodies were generated to inhibit some but not all HIV‐1 strains, and it was particularly challenging to inhibit certain strains classified as “difficult‐to‐neutralize”.[137] It was discussed how the nanoparticle design might be improved by reducing steric hindrance between adjacent Env trimers. He et al. refined the structure‐based design of the trimeric Env antigens presented on the ferritin nanoparticle surface along with optimizing spacing between the trimers in order to yield more robust B cell responses.[138] More detailed engineering of the Env antigen structure increased Env trimer recognition on the ferritin nanoparticles by a broader range of naïve B cells, resulting in elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.[139] Due to the high sequence variation among Env proteins across different HIV‐1 strains, Sliepen et al. have designed a new Env antigen structure based on a consequence sequence incorporating the epitopes of many broadly neutralizing antibodies, and presented the Env antigen trimers on ferritin nanoparticles to yield strong neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits and macaques.[140] In addition, He et al. have reported additional protein engineering efforts to improve the stability of wild‐type Env antigens by switching out the ectodomain with a more stable version from an engineered Env antigen, which enabled improved generation of neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit difficult‐to‐neutralize HIV‐1 strains, in mice and rabbits.[141] Together, the ongoing work with ferritin‐Env nanoparticle vaccines to prevent HIV‐1 infection demonstrates the superior immune responses generated by antigen trimers on the nanoparticle surface, while highlighting the potential to combine these nanomaterial efforts with antigen‐based protein engineering efforts. Such possibilities have also been explored for a wide range of other viruses and support the broad versatility of ferritin nanoparticle technology for developing next‐generation vaccines. Kanekiyo et al. have designed a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) infection by conjugating ferritin molecules to a truncated domain from the EBV gp350 protein that contains the receptor‐binding site needed for B cell infection.[142] On the ferritin nanoparticle surface, the antigen formed dimers, which is a distinct conformation to the trimeric presentation cases discussed above. Importantly, compared to the soluble gp350 antigen, the nanoparticle vaccine still elicited markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies by 10‐ to 100‐fold in mice and nonhuman primates and also conferred protective immunity on mice in a lethal virus challenge model. Bu et al. have also developed another form of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent EBV infection based on a different antigen (gH), which alone and in complexation with gL and gp42 proteins helps to generate neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus‐cell fusion and works against multiple cell types instead of only preventing B cell infection.[143] In another important example, Wang et al. have reported a dual‐targeting, ferritin nanoparticle vaccine strategy to prevent and treat chronic HBV infection in mice based on activating two types of immune cells to induce high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibodies.[144] Recent work has further demonstrated that ferritin nanoparticles are an excellent platform to present viral antigens for developing HCV vaccines that might work against a wide range of HCV genotypes[145] and also to develop vaccines for treating RSV infection.[146] Notably, in the latter case, a glycosylated version of the RSV antigen was designed that induced a higher ratio of neutralizing antibodies to non‐neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates, which could be significant because higher levels of non‐neutralizing antibodies are thought to be associated with antibody‐mediated disease enhancement.[146] In addition to fabricating ferritin nanoparticles composed of one type of building block component, there has been interest in developing two‐component ferritin nanoparticles in order to present oligomers of multiple antigens on the nanoparticle surface. For example, Georgiev et al. reported the development of ferritin nanoparticles composed of two types of ferritin constructs, one of which was fused to an influenza virus antigen and the other one of which was fused to an HIV‐1 antigen, and nanoparticle self‐assembly resulted in trimeric presentation of both antigens.[147] Importantly, vaccination with this nanoparticle strategy in guinea pigs could induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibited both viruses. Since there are many different subtypes of influenza virus, Kanekiyo et al. expanded on this nanoparticle design strategy to design and coassemble ferritin‐HA constructs encoding HA with one of two receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) and the resulting nanoparticles had mosaic HA trimers that presented a mixture of RBDs to yield a broader antibody response than nanoparticles with either RBD alone.[148] Vaccination in mice led to the discovery of a neutralizing antibody that works against a wide range of influenza virus strains. Accordingly, nanoparticle‐based strategies presenting multiple antigens have been suggested as one possible route to create a universal influenza vaccine.[25] While ferritin nanoparticles have proven useful for creating vaccine nanoparticle technology, there has been extensive interest in identifying other natural protein scaffolds that can self‐assemble into nanoparticles with different sizes. Also in 2013, Jardine et al. reported the development of ≈32 nm diameter, self‐assembling nanoparticles composed of 60 recombinantly expressed lumazine synthase (LS) protein molecules from Aquifex aeolicus, which exhibit symmetrical organization, and designed an LS fusion protein together with HIV‐1 Env antigen that could form nanoparticles with enhanced B cell activation and lymph node trafficking properties.[149] In follow‐up work, an improved version of the LS nanoparticle vaccine platform was designed and induced promising immune responses in different mouse models in vivo, toward the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV‐1 infection.[150] Havenar‐Daughton et al. further investigated single‐dose immunization of rhesus monkeys with this HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccine and noted that subcutaneous immunization yielded markedly larger B cell responses and lymph node drainage than intramuscular drainage.[151] Tokatlian et al. have also explored how antigen glycosylation of LS‐ and ferritin‐based HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines is an important factor in modulating antibody responses (Figure 7e,f).[135] The results demonstrated that antigen glycosylation is an important factor in eliciting high levels of antigen‐specific antibody levels and appreciably lower levels were observed with deglycosylated antigen (Figure 7g). Additionally, Krebs et al. have investigated ≈23 nm diameter nanoparticle self‐assembly from the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in order to create nanoparticle vaccines presenting an HIV‐1 Env antigen fragment, which yielded an antigen‐specific antibody in immunized rabbits although multiple rounds of immunization were needed to elicit moderately protective, neutralizing antibody levels in a large fraction of rabbits.[152] As seen in these examples, it is important to point out that self‐assembled nanoparticles from different natural protein scaffolds have distinct functionalities, as noted by how protein scaffolds fused together with full‐length viral protein antigens can only self‐assemble into nanoparticles for some, but not all, of the scaffold options and antigen spacing is another important factor affecting both nanoparticle self‐assembly and immunogenicity.[138] In part, such design issues have motivated the use of full‐length viral proteins or truncated versions thereof and the type of nanoparticle structure can also affect antigen oligomerization in some cases.[142] Another important point concerns the nanoparticle vaccine fabrication strategy. To date, the structural components of virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines have been recombinantly expressed in host cells in vitro and, upon expression, spontaneously self‐assemble into antigen‐presenting nanoparticles. In such cases, the nanoparticle vaccine suspension is then injected into animals as part of the immunization process. As an alternative strategy, recent work has also investigated nucleic‐acid‐based vaccination strategies that could enable the in vivo expression of nanoparticle structural components and, in some cases, in vivo self‐assembly of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. Melo et al. reported the development of a lipid‐nanoparticle‐encapsulated alphavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) replicon encoding the HIV Env antigen fused with LS.[153] A single injection of this lipid nanoparticle suspension encoding the HIV Env antigen yielded high levels of Env‐specific antibodies and also led to improved B cell responses compared to recombinant protein immunization. In another demonstration, Xu et al. reported the use of a DNA vaccine plasmid to induce the in vivo expression of a nanoparticle structural component comprising an HIV Env antigen fused with LS, and demonstrated its in vivo structural assembly in mice based on functional studies along with improved immune responses in mice and guinea pigs compared to immunization with a similar delivery strategy encoding antigen monomers only.[154] The design concept was further generalized to other natural protein scaffolds, such as ferritin nanoparticles, which also induced high immune responses and the delivery strategy could also be adapted to influenza HA antigen in order to endow mice with protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge. From a translational perspective, there has been tremendous progress in developing ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccines for preventing influenza infections based on ongoing human clinical trials being conducted in the United States. Preliminary data from the first‐in‐human trial (NCT03186781) of a ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccine provided initial evidence that the vaccine is safe and well‐tolerated in humans while another human clinical trial (NCT03814720) is ongoing to evaluate the dosing, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ferritin‐HA‐stem nanoparticles as a potential universal flu vaccine candidate. 7.2.2 Engineered Protein Scaffolds The insights gained from nanoparticle vaccines based on self‐assembling natural protein scaffolds have highlighted the importance of tuning antigen structure, conformation, density, and spacing on the nanoparticle surface. While several types of self‐assembling proteins exist in nature, the number of options is intrinsically limited, which has prompted researchers to further explore the design of nanoparticle vaccines from self‐assembling, engineered protein scaffolds that enable greater control over nanomaterial properties. Toward this goal, King et al. reported computational strategies to design 24‐subunit protein nanomaterials composed of two types of self‐assembling protein subunit components, and experimentally demonstrated that it was possible to rationally tune the nanomaterial structure, shape, and symmetry in alignment with the computational designs.[155] In another study, Bale et al. applied similar approaches to design larger, two‐component protein nanomaterials composed of 120 subunits with icosahedral symmetry and had 24–40 nm diameters that are similar to the size of small viral capsids.[156] Another advantage of using two‐component engineered proteins is greater control over the fabrication process. Natural protein scaffolds self‐assemble upon recombinant expression while engineered protein components can be expressed independently and then mixed as desired to self‐assemble into nanoparticles in vitro. Marcandalli et al. reported the first example of an engineered‐protein‐based nanoparticle vaccine that was built from two self‐assembling components and presented multiple copies of a trimeric RSV envelope antigen termed DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8a,b).[157] One protein component was designed to present DS‐Cav1 and spontaneously formed trimers by itself, while the other protein component formed pentamers by itself. The two protein components were expressed independently and, when mixed together in vitro, 20 trimers of the first protein component and 12 pentamers of the second protein component self‐assembled to form two‐component nanoparticles with ≈55 nm diameter inclusive of the antigen trimer spikes. Unlike previous nanoparticle vaccine designs, it was possible to control the density of DS‐Cav1 antigen trimer on the nanoparticle surface based on mixing different amounts of the first protein component with a genetically fused version of the first protein component that presents DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8c). Importantly, the nanoparticle presentation of DS‐Cav1 trimers not only improved antigen physical stability but also nanoparticle vaccine immunization in mice and nonhuman primates led to nearly 10‐fold higher neutralizing antibody titers along with a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response than immunization with soluble DS‐Cav1 trimers (Figure 8d). Brouwer et al. have also used a similar two‐component nanoparticle strategy to present HIV‐1 envelope antigen trimers.[158] In this case, the two‐component nanoparticle induced particularly high antibody responses after a single round of immunization, as compared to the same antigen trimers in soluble form and displayed on single‐component ferritin nanoparticles. There is ongoing exploration of different nanoparticle shape designs[159] and how nanoparticle formulations can improve lymph node targeting in nonhuman primate models.[160] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ) and the bar indicates the geometric mean, which is listed for each test group.

In terms of COVID‐19 vaccine development, Walls et al. recently reported the development of a two‐component nanoparticle vaccine candidate that displays the RBD of a SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope protein antigen (Figure 8e).[161] From a nanomaterial design perspective, a key innovation was introducing a genetically encoded flexible linker to connect the smaller RBD domain with the main nanoparticle structure. It is also noteworthy that the basic self‐assembling nanoparticle design involved the same two protein components as in the RSV and HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines described above, demonstrating the modular nature of nanoparticle vaccines and the ability to rationally swap antigens to support rapid vaccine development (Figure 8f). Importantly, the COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine induced nearly ten‐fold greater neutralizing antibody titers in mice than a soluble antigen trimer even when the nanoparticles were administered at a five‐time lower dose (Figure 8g). The nanoparticle vaccine also induced a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response, as compared to human convalescent sera. This immune response resulted in complete protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an in vivo virus challenge mouse model (Figure 8h). The combination of these features has further spurred ongoing manufacturing efforts to create a COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine in abundant quantities for potential human clinical trials. Looking forward, Ueda et al. have also continued designing new nanoparticle vaccine designs that are tailored for different types of viral protein domains[157] and there is excellent potential to continue exploring protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. As control over the molecular‐level biomimetic features of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines continues to improve, there will be growing emphasis on production scalability and how these nanoparticle vaccines can compete with other vaccine candidates in terms of practical factors such as cost, storage, and scalability. 7.2.3 Additional Scaffold Options While there has been tremendous progress in developing protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines to prevent viral infections, liposome‐ and inorganic nanoparticle‐based strategies have also proven advantageous and demonstrate important nanomaterial desiBiomimetic Nanomaterial Strategies for Virus Targeting: Antiviral Therapies and VaccinesBiomimetic nanomaterials have excellent potential to combat viral infections and lay the groundwork for next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

Since virus particles are nanoscale entities, nanomaterial design strategies are ideally suited to create advanced materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles. In this progress report, the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials are critically discussed for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Particular focus is placed on nanomaterial design concepts and material innovations that can be readily developed to thwart future viral threats. Pertinent nanomaterial examples from the COVID‐19 situation are also covered along with discussion of human clinical trial efforts underway that might lead to next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there have been growing calls to recognize that emerging infectious diseases represent a major threat to global health and that we must be better prepared to deal with a future viral pandemic, which could arise from an unknown or understudied virus.[1] In 2018, the World Health Organization expanded on these viewpoints by preparing a list of viral and nonviral pathogens that could cause Disease X, a future human disease outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential that would be triggered by a newly emerged pathogen.[2] In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic arose as the first Disease X and was caused by the global spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has infected over 39 million people and caused over 1 100 000 deaths to date.[3] COVID‐19 is considered by some experts to be a once‐in‐a‐century pandemic[4] and has highlighted how viral pandemics can create a perfect storm of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that is disrupting the institutions of daily life worldwide, including work, healthcare, education, and transportation.[5] Our understanding of COVID‐19 continues to grow since a local outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and led to the discovery of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is related to other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[6] SARS‐CoV‐2 is believed to be a zoonotic virus that crossed over from bats[7] and acquired mutations via natural selection that caused the virus to more efficiently infect human cells and transmit among humans.[8] Early reports of human respiratory disease[9] have since been followed up by numerous, ongoing studies to gain further insight into COVID‐19 disease pathogenesis, including how severe cases of COVID‐19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.[10] Various organs are affected by the disease, including lungs,[11] heart,[12] liver,[13] kidney,[14] and brain.[15] As such, there has been tremendous attention placed on the treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and growing attention to the role that materials science can play in stopping COVID‐19 and, more broadly, the wide range of viral infections affecting global society along with future viral threats.[16] The objective of this progress report is to cover the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Major emphasis is placed on covering the most recent developments mainly within the past three years, while distilling key nanomaterial design principles that can lead to next‐generation advanced materials for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Where applicable, we also discuss how these nanomaterial strategies are being explored to stop SARS‐CoV‐2 along with coverage of relevant human clinical trial efforts.

2 Advanced Materials for Virus Targeting Virus particles (“virions”) are biological nanoparticles that contain viral genetic material and are surrounded by a protein or lipid bilayer membrane coating. The particles are typically around 50–300 nm in diameter and are functionalized with glycoproteins that play an important role in binding to cells.[17] There are two main types: enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Membrane‐enveloped viruses are surrounded by a host‐cell‐derived lipid membrane that contains embedded glycoproteins while nonenveloped viruses have a protein‐based capsid shell without lipid membrane.[18] In both cases, the glycoproteins on the virus particle surface are the major antigens, which are recognized by the host immune system and can elicit an antibody response.[19] Once the immune system is trained to recognize a viral antigen, the immune system can rapidly produce antibodies that bind to the virus particles and prevent them from causing infection.[20] Fundamentally, virus particles are parasites that must infect susceptible cells and highjack cellular machinery in order to produce new virus particles.[21] The basic steps are presented in Scheme 1a. The first step involves virus particle binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface, which can result in cellular entry and start of the infection process. Each type of cell has a characteristic pattern of receptors found on the cellular surface and different viruses bind preferentially to particular ones. For example, many viruses bind specifically to glycan‐functionalized receptors containing sulfonate or sialyl functional groups. Infected cells produce new copies of viral genetic material and viral proteins, which are then assembled in order to produce new virus particles that are released extracellularly and infect new cells. The process continues indefinitely until an organism succumbs to virus‐induced cellular damage and related immune responses, and viruses can also spread between organisms via a wide range of transmission mechanisms. Scheme 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Biomimetic nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. a) Overview of virus life cycle. Viruses cannot replicate independently and must infect cells. The replication machinery of infected cells is highjacked by viruses and used to create new copies of the viral genome and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles that are released from the cell and spread to infect other cells. b) Examples of different nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. i) Nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors can inhibit the production of new virus particles. ii) Virus‐binding nanoparticles and iii) cell membrane decoys can bind to virus particles and prevent viral infection of cells. iv) Viral membrane inhibitors can disrupt membrane‐enveloped virus particles, abrogating infectivity. v) Extracorporeal blood filters can remove circulating virus particles from the bloodstream to reduce disease burden. vi) Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines that mimic the multivalent presentation of antigens on virus particle surfaces can elicit improved immune responses that lead to greater protection against future virus exposure. Depending on the objective, various nanomaterial strategies can be useful to stop viruses, as presented in Scheme 1b. Conventionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to inhibit viral genome replication inside infected cells, thereby preventing the production of new virus particles.[22] Nanomaterial strategies have proven useful to enhance the pharmacological properties of viral genome replication inhibitors, including circulation time. While it is advantageous to stop viral genome replication in order to help treat existing viral infections, there is also extensive interest in exploring how nanomaterials can be useful to prevent viral infections.[23] Virus‐binding nanomaterials can attach to virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells. Pristine nanomaterials can be used along with receptor‐functionalized ones and cell‐membrane‐decoy nanomaterials, which are coated with cell membrane extracts containing natural receptors. Ongoing efforts have also devised nanomaterial‐based strategies to effectively remove extracellular virus particles from infected organisms by either selectively disrupting virus particles or by removing them through extracorporeal filtration strategies. Moreover, some of the most recent and innovative advances have come from developing nanoparticle vaccines, especially self‐assembling protein‐based ones, which have demonstrated excellent potential to prevent multiple types of viral infections.[24] One of the most promising candidates has been rapidly advanced into human clinical trials as a potential universal flu vaccine[25] and similar strategies are now being applied to SARS‐CoV‐2. A key innovative aspect of these nanoparticle vaccines is that critical architectural properties of virus particles, particularly the specific organization of glycoprotein antigens, can now be mimicked with nanoscale precision and these advanced material capabilities have led to nanoparticle vaccine candidates with superior immunizing capabilities to currently used vaccine strategies in some cases. The latest progress in all of these areas is covered in the following sections.

3 Viral Replication Inhibitors The most widely used class of direct‐acting antiviral drugs encompasses small molecules that inhibit the genome replication of viruses inside infected cells.[26] These replication processes involve a multiprotein replication complex called the viral replicase[27] and antiviral therapy often targets one or more types of the viral proteins that form this complex. Key examples of antiviral drugs in this class include nucleoside and nucleotide analogues that inhibit the viral polymerase, which is the main enzyme involved in viral genome production.[28] Over the years, there have been extensive efforts to develop prodrugs[29]—inactive molecules that are metabolized into the active drug in vivo—and drug delivery systems that enable longer circulation time, targeted delivery, and/or improved safety of viral replication inhibitors, in line with broader innovation trends in the nanomedicine field as a whole. Promising examples include development of a once weekly, orally administered antiviral drug delivery platform that consists of several polymer matrices with different drug release profiles in order to consistently maintain pharmaceutically relevant concentrations of antiviral drugs in systemic circulation.[30] One of the most recent examples of cutting‐edge nanomaterial strategies to deliver viral replication inhibitors involves the class of macromolecular prodrugs, comprising polymer‐functionalized antiviral drugs in complexation with serum proteins. Andersen et al. described the formation of polymer–protein–drug complexes that enable long‐duration therapy with multiple antiviral drugs.[31] A polymer–protein complex comprised of a single, ≈7 kDa N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (PHPMA) chain per covalently attached albumin molecule was designed and exhibited much longer circulation half‐time and higher concentrations in mice upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as compared to free PHPMA alone. Marked accumulation of the polymer–protein complex in mouse lymph nodes was also reported. Two antiviral drugs, azidothymidine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), were covalently incorporated into the monomer backbone via a labile disulfide linkage for eventual intracellular release of free drug molecules. These functionalized building blocks were assembled into a colloidal‐like polymer–protein–drug complex consisting of one polymer chain with six AZT and four 3TC copies along with one albumin molecule and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human T cells in vitro. Frich et al. expanded on this macromolecular prodrug strategy by devising a “hitchhiking” scheme in which a polymer–drug conjugate was fabricated and exhibited noncovalent binding to serum albumin proteins, as indicated by biophysical experiments and increased circulation half‐time in mice in vivo.[32] The key innovation was functionalizing the PHPMA component with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) lipid, which is a binding ligand for serum albumin proteins found in circulation (Figure 1a). A polymer–drug conjugate was synthesized consisting of DSPE–PHPMA and multiple copies of acyclovir (ACV), which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpes simplex virus (HSV). It was verified that free ACV could be released from the DSPE–PHPMA–ACV complex upon incubation in physiologically relevant conditions containing glutathione (GSH). It was determined that >100 × 10−9 m ACV was released within 3 h from 1 g L–1 PHPMA–ACV in GSH‐containing phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) while nearly negligible release was observed over an appreciably longer time period of 24 h in PBS without GSH. Importantly, DSPE–PHPMA–ACV also exhibited antiviral activity against HSV type 2 (HSV‐2) infection of baby hamster kidney‐derived ELVIS and human cervix‐derived HeLa cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous administration of the polymer–drug complex helped to suppress vaginal HSV‐2 infection in an in vivo mouse model based on viral infectivity measurements of vaginal wash and spinal cord specimens (Figure 1b).

DSPE‐PHPMA was found to bind noncovalently to serum albumin proteins, which was associated with a longer circulation half‐time in mice. By contrast, PHPMA alone did not bind appreciably to albumins. b) Effect of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered DSPE‐PHPMA‐ACV, PHPMA‐ACV, free ACV, and no treatment (N.t.) on vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2) infection in an in vivo mouse model.

In addition to forming polymer–drug complexes, recent efforts have focused on creating macromolecular prodrugs from chemical derivatives of nucleoside analogues that can form nucleic acid scaffolds. For example, Krüger et al. demonstrated that idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to treat HSV infection, could be converted into a phosphoramidite derivative and then these building blocks were used to synthesize linear nucleic acid scaffolds with 7 or 14 attached drug molecules (Figure 1c).[33] In vitro release experiments revealed that the scaffolds are stable in serum‐free cell culture medium while free idoxuridine was gradually released within 2–6 h in the presence of serum, indicating the potential utility of these scaffolds for in vivo applications (Figure 1d). Future work needs to continue exploring the prophylactic and therapeutic utility of macromolecular prodrugs of viral replication inhibitors in animal models, while there exist numerous potential advantages in terms of well‐defined colloidal properties and targeted codelivery of two or more antiviral drugs to increase the barrier for drug‐resistant virus strains to emerge.[34] There also remains an outstanding need to investigate the mechanisms of drug release in vivo and to also continue exploring how macromolecular prodrugs can be engineered to target specific organs.

4 Virus Particle Binding Inhibitors 4.1 Pristine Nanomaterials Over the years, various classes of nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based nanomaterials have been synthesized and there are well‐developed methods to control atomic composition, size, and functional groups. Accordingly, systematic studies have long been conducted to test how different types of pristine nanomaterials—as‐synthesized nanomaterials without additional surface functionalization—affect virus particles and have revealed a variety of antiviral mechanisms related to virus particle binding and steric blocking, chemical reactions involving nanomaterial‐induced reactive species, and virus particle disruption, as extensively covered in numerous reviews.[35] To date, however, most of these antiviral activities have been characterized in vitro, while it is more challenging to use pristine nanomaterials in vivo where they can show diminished antiviral activity. Key challenges include nonspecific binding of nanomaterials to other biological components and the protein corona that can form spontaneously on nanomaterial surfaces upon immersion in physiological environments.[36] In addition to conventional nanomaterial options, there has also been extensive interest in designing nanomaterials from poorly soluble antimicrobial compounds, which can improve solubility and potential usability in some cases. For example, Huang et al. reported the fabrication of water‐dispersible, benzoxazine monomer‐derived carbon dots with ≈4 nm diameter, which inhibited a wide range of viruses, including Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and Dengue (Figure 2a).[37] Significant reductions in viral infectivity in vitro against baby hamster kidney‐derived BHK‐21 and monkey kidney‐derived Vero cells were observed upon pretreatment of virus particles with the carbon dots (Figure 2b,c). Another study involved the fabrication of water‐dispersible, glycyrrhizic acid‐derived carbon dots that inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of nonhuman primate‐derived MARC‐145, Vero, and pig kidney‐derived PK‐15 cells by suppressing viral genome replication and stimulating innate immune responses.[38] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint –1 BZM‐CDs.

Taking inspiration from how a wide range of biological materials have spiky surfaces for increased adhesion, one of the most recent advances has been the development of spiky nanostructures that have improved contact with virus particles (Figure 2d). Based on the complex topology of spherical influenza virus particles, including the presence of protruding glycoproteins, Nie et al. fabricated spiky silica nanoparticles that exhibited improved adhesion to the virus particles, as compared to smooth silica nanoparticles (Figure 2e).[39] The spike dimensions were optimized so that the nanoparticle spikes could fit well in between the glycoprotein protrusions (Figure 2f,g). Notably, however, the spiky silica nanoparticles had low aqueous dispersibility, so they were initially coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) but did not inhibit influenza virus infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK‐II cells in vitro. Therefore, the spiky silica nanoparticles were coated with a red blood cell membrane extract, which facilitated antiviral activity in vitro, as indicated by reduced virus particle binding to cells and decreased viral infectivity. Cell membrane coatings are further discussed in Section 4.3 below and this example provides insight into how the biological functionality of nanomaterials can be modulated based on the surface coating. A combination of binding ligands and antiviral drugs was further conjugated on the spiky nanoparticle surface to enhance antiviral activity against influenza virus and inhibit infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro.[40] Porous gold nanoparticles with a high surface area have also been reported to inhibit infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK cells by a wide range of influenza virus strains in vitro.[41] Ultimately, such studies have provided insight into how nanoparticle composition and shape can influence antiviral activity and this research direction has been greatly enhanced in recent years by integrating nanomaterial design together with biomimetic surface functionalization with cell‐mimicking receptors and cell membrane extracts. 4.2 Receptor‐Functionalized Nanomaterials 4.2.1 Sulfonated Nanoparticles Virus particle attachment to cell membrane receptors is a critical first step in the infection process and, for many types of viruses, involves viral protein binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors that are present on cell surfaces.[42] As such, stopping these virus‐cell binding interactions via competitive inhibitors can prevent infection and various classes of sulfonated polysaccharides have been explored, including heparin[43] and heparin‐like molecules[44] along with metal complexes of sulfonated molecules, and exhibit antiviral activity in vitro.[45] Many of these antiviral molecules have been explored as topical microbicides to prevent vaginal transmission of viruses such as HIV, however, none have demonstrated efficacy in late‐stage clinical trials and intracorporeal efficacy is more challenging to achieve.[46] In light of these shortcomings and the potential utility of this biomimetic design concept in principle, there has been extensive interest in developing sulfonated nanoparticles with a well‐controlled, multivalent presentation of sulfonate groups to inhibit susceptible viruses. Baram‐Pinto et al. reported that sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection of Vero cells in vitro by preventing cell entry of virus particles and hence reducing cell‐to‐cell spreading as well.[47] Notably, the sulfonate groups in that study were attached to gold nanoparticles via short‐chain linkers with low conformational flexibility. Cagno et al. further investigated the design of sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles with short‐chain, low‐flexibility and long‐chain, high‐flexibility linkers and discovered that the use of more flexible chains enabled improved antiviral activity in vitro with Vero cells, ex vivo with human epivaginal tissue cultures, and in vivo in mice (Figure 3a).[48] While both types of sulfonate‐functionalized nanoparticles could bind to and inhibit viruses such as HSV‐2, only the nanoparticles with flexible linkers could inhibit viruses upon dilution due to stronger binding interactions and heparin was also inactive (Figure 3b–d). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that nanoparticle‐virus particle interactions in the latter case resulted in virus particle disruption, indicating a virucidal (“virus‐killing”) type of mechanism (Figure 3e–g). Intranasal administration of the sulfonated nanoparticles also prophylactically inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice in vivo.

Sulfonate‐functionalized inorganic nanoparticles as virucidal inhibitors to disrupt virus particles. a) Schematic illustration of nanoparticle strategies to inhibit virus particles that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on cellular surfaces during the infection process. The basic concept is to create biomimetic nanoparticles with sulfonate groups that can tightly bind to virus particles to prevent virus binding to HSPG cell receptors. Top row: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with low‐flexibility 3‐mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES), termed MES‐AuNPs, can bind relatively weakly to virus particles to prevent infection. However, the inhibitory effect of MES‐AuNPs is lost upon dilution and the virus particles remain infective. Bottom: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with high‐flexibility undecanesulfonic acid (MUS), termed MUS‐AuNPs, can bind relatively strongly to virus particles and prevent infection. The inhibitory effect of MUS‐AuNPs is maintained upon dilution and nullifies viral infectivity due to irreversible virus particle disruption.

Building on this work, Zacheo et al. recently explored how controlling the properties of the sulfonated ligands on the gold nanoparticle surface affects the degree of antiviral activity and identified glucose‐ and lactose‐based ligands with virucidal activity against Dengue virus to inhibit infection of Vero and human liver‐derived HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro.[49] Dey et al. have also reported the fabrication of ≈100–200 nm diameter, hydrogel‐like sulfonated nanogel particles and demonstrated that the nanogels can block HSV‐1 infection of monkey kidney‐derived Vero E6 cells in vitro.[50] Importantly, several types of nanogels were designed with different degrees of flexibility and more flexible nanogels showed greater antiviral activity. Cyclodextrin scaffolds functionalized with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids have also exhibited broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against numerous medically important viruses and further testing showed that HSV did not acquire resistance to the sulfonated cyclodextrin scaffolds.[51] The in vitro antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of money kidney‐derived Vero‐CCL81 and Vero E6 cells has been described in at least two recent works,[52] supporting that nanomaterial strategies involving sulfonate groups might be effective antiviral strategies to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 as well. 4.2.2 Sialylated Nanoparticles Different viruses bind to specific types of cell surface receptors as part of the infection process and another key example involves the influenza virus, which is a leading cause of respiratory viral infections.[53] Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins on the influenza virus particle surface bind to sialic acid‐containing glycan molecules that are prevalent on the surface of human lung cells as well as those of different animal species.[54] As with sulfonate‐related binding interactions and protein–glycan interactions in general, individual events of viral protein binding to sialic acids are relatively weak and strong interactions depend on multivalency.[55] Accordingly, a wide range of nanomaterial scaffolds with multiple sialic acid residues have been designed to competitively bind to influenza virus particles and thus prevent viral infection. Recent efforts have focused on how precisely tuning the distance between sialic acid residues on the scaffold affects HA binding. For example, Bandlow et al. investigated how rigid scaffolds composed of self‐assembled complexes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) enhanced binding interactions compared to more flexible, polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.[56] This finding agreed well with antiviral testing data on rigid and flexible core trivalent sialosides too.[57] Another important design variable has been considering linear versus branched scaffolds.[58] In one promising example, Kwon et al. reported the fabrication of a branched polyamidoamine scaffold that mirrored the inter‐spacing distance between HA proteins on influenza virus particles and intranasal administration of this scaffold was able to protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection.[59] Other recent examples include more sophisticated nanomaterial designs involving three‐way nucleic acid junctions[60] and star glycopolymers.[61] In addition to polymer‐like scaffolds, there has been ongoing exploration of sialic‐functionalized nanoparticles and a key example involves bacteriophage capsid nanoparticles with well‐controlled spacing of sialic acid‐functionalized ligands (Figure 4a,b).[62] Capsid nanoparticles with the correct Sia1 sialic acid ligands could specifically bind to influenza virus particles while nanoparticles functionalized with other glycan ligands did not bind to virus particles (Figure 4c,d). Likewise, only Sia1‐functionalized nanoparticles could inhibit influenza virus infection of MDCK‐II and human lung‐derived A549 cells in vitro in a dose‐dependent fashion and influenza virus pretreatment with the nanoparticles also protected mice from infection‐related weight loss in vivo (Figure 4e,f).

In addition, negative control Qβ capsids were prepared by conjugating N‐acetylgalactosamine (Gal) with a triethylene glycol linker to form Qβ[Gal3].

Richard et al. have also systematically investigated how sialic acid‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can be designed in terms of core nanoparticle size and linker length and unraveled how these parameters influence multivalent binding interactions, which can give rise to highly specific binding to particular ligand geometries.[63] In terms of soft‐matter nanoparticles, Bhatia et al. have also investigated the design of ≈250 nm diameter sialylated nanogel particles with varying degrees of flexibility and observed that highly flexible nanogel particles inhibited cell attachment of influenza virus by up to 400 times, as compared to more rigid nanogel particles.[64] The flexible nanogel particles also prevented influenza infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro down to picomolar concentrations. In another interesting example, Kong et al. reported the development of sialic acid‐functionalized lipid nanodisks that can bind to and cause perforation of influenza virus particles.[65] This example demonstrated that sialic acid‐functionalized nanoparticles can exhibit additional mechanistic functions beyond inhibiting virus‐cell interactions only and intravenous administration of the nanodisks also protected mice against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. In addition to new nanoparticle designs, there has been extensive recent progress in developing nanoscience measurement tools to quantify influenza viral protein‐sialic acid binding interactions. For example, single‐molecule force spectroscopy experiments have been conducted to comparatively measure the binding strength of influenza HA and neuraminidase proteins to sialic acid receptors[66] and the effects of multivalency on such interactions.[67] Di Iorio et al. have also fabricated sialic acid‐functionalized lipid bilayers and measured the binding of ≈22 nm diameter clusters of recombinant influenza HA proteins to supported lipid bilayers by quartz crystal microbalance‐dissipation (QCM‐D) experiments.[68] Other techniques such as microcavity arrays can also measure the diffusional motion of HA proteins bound to sialic acid‐functionalized supported lipid bilayers.[69] To date, most of these measurement strategies have been employed for understanding the fundamental role of multivalency in viral protein–glycan interactions while there remains tremendous potential to utilize these approaches for evaluating the functional performance of new nanomaterial inhibitors as well as to test drug inhibitor candidates that prevent such interactions.[70] 4.2.3 Additional Strategies In addition to glycan‐based decoy binding strategies for competitive inhibition, nucleic acid nanostructures have enabled creative design possibilities based on self‐assembling, complex topologies. For example, Kwon et al. reported the design of 3D DNA nanostructures with highly precise architectural features and incorporated Dengue viral protein‐binding aptamers within the nanostructure, which could bind multivalently to Dengue virus particles.[71] Different nanostructures such as heptagons, hexagons, and stars were tested and it was discovered that the star nanostructure yielded the most potent inhibitory activity to prevent Dengue virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to inhibit Dengue virus was around 2 × 10−9 m for star nanostructures, as compared to 10 × 10−9 and 440 × 10−9 m for the hexagon and heptagon nanostructures, respectively. This example provides an important demonstration of how synthetic receptors can be engineered in the future to develop more potent nanomaterial options, especially from natural, biocompatible materials, and with self‐assembling properties. These synthetic capabilities have also inspired current efforts to develop nanomaterial inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 based on understanding what receptor the virus binds and how to design receptor‐mimicking decoys. Specifically, the latest scientific evidence supports that SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the membrane‐associated angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell surfaces as part of the infection process.[72] Han et al. have reported the computational design of peptides that correspond to structurally important regions of ACE2 and can bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins to prevent infection.[73] It was suggested that the inhibitory peptides could be attached to nanoparticles with multivalent presentation, while such design strategies would require a careful consideration of how to best optimize the peptide attachment in terms of attachment chemistry, flexibility, density, and peptide conformation. There is also interest in engineering the ACE2 protein to bind more strongly to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins[74] and experimental work to test antiviral peptide inhibitors in this direction is ongoing. 4.3 Cell Membrane Decoys Over the past decade, there has been extensive and rapidly growing interest in coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane extracts to confer advantageous biological properties. For example, Hu et al. demonstrated that coating polymeric nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes can increase circulation time in mice.[75] It has also been demonstrated that cloaking polymeric nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of human platelets can improve immunocompatibility in terms of lower macrophage uptake and reduced complement activation, along with additional platelet‐like functionalities.[76] Ongoing progress in the field has also sparked interest in developing cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles that contain virus‐binding receptors and hence can bind to virus particles in order to prevent infection.[77] Numerous viruses such as Dengue and Zika are transmitted by mosquito vectors[78] and Rao et al. demonstrated that gelatin nanoparticles coated with mosquito cell membrane extracts can bind to Zika virus particles, whereby each ≈130 nm diameter nanoparticle binds to multiple virus particles.[79] This approach led to dose‐dependent reduction in viral infectivity of Vero cells in vitro and intravenous administration of the coated nanoparticles up to 2 days postinoculation also protected mice against virus‐induced mortality and body weight loss and reduced the level of viral infection in the brain. Red blood cell membrane‐coated magnetic nanoparticles with sialylated functional groups have also been employed to capture influenza virus particles.[80] In addition to using natural cell membrane extracts that contain typical amounts of virus‐binding receptors, there have been attempts to engineer cells to overexpress those receptors and to prepare cell‐derived membrane vesicles accordingly. For example, Liu et al. devised a biosynthetic strategy to overexpress the membrane receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is called human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), in HepG2 cells and prepared ≈200 nm diameter, cell membrane‐derived vesicles that were used to inhibit HBV infection of HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro and in mice with humanized livers in vivo (Figure 5a).[81] Compared to control membrane vesicles from the parent cell line with normal receptor quantities, the membrane vesicles from the engineered cell line with an overexpressed quantity of receptors exhibited appreciably greater antiviral activity levels and demonstrated improved treatment efficacy in the mouse model, as indicated by lower levels of HBV antibodies and nucleic acid copies (Figure 5b,c). Recently, Rao et al. reported the fabrication of cell membrane‐derived vesicles from human monocyte cells that were genetically engineered to express the ACE2 receptor and the ACE2‐functionalized vesicles could prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro.[82] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint [ 81 ] Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH. d) Strategy to capture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus particles by using cell‐membrane‐coated polymeric nanoparticles termed nanosponges (NS).

Similar approaches have also been taken to treat and prevent infection by HIV, which is known to infect T cells.[83] Polymeric nanoparticles were coated with the plasma membranes of CD4+ T cells, which contain the receptors needed for virus binding and cell entry, and the cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human‐monocyte‐derived macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, it was suggested that this cell membrane decoy strategy could be potentially advantageous to work against multiple, genetically diverse HIV strains because all strains bind to the same cell receptors.[85] A follow‐up study confirmed that the T cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit a wide range of HIV‐1 strains and surprisingly induced autophagy of HIV‐infected cells to suppress viral genome replication but had no effect on uninfected cells.[86] Recently, cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles have also been developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro (Figure 5d).[84] Nanoparticles coated with extracts from human lung epithelial type II or macrophage cells inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent fashion while nanoparticles coated with extracts from red blood cells were inactive (Figure 5e). These findings emphasize the importance of rationally designing biomimetic nanomaterial strategies based on a precise understanding of how a certain virus affects cells, and further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of these inhibitory capabilities in vivo.

5 Viral Membrane Inhibitors Most nanomaterial‐based antiviral strategies focus on targeting viral protein components in order to prevent virus‐cell binding interactions as described in the preceding examples. However, various types of viruses use distinct binding receptors to enter cells and such strategies are therefore intrinsically limited to working against a relatively narrow subset of viruses. On the other hand, many viral epidemics are caused by membrane‐enveloped viruses and a structurally intact viral membrane on enveloped viruses is necessary for viral infectivity, including virus‐cell fusion.[87] As such, a wide range of broad‐spectrum antiviral drug candidates have been explored to inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses based on targeting the viral membrane.[87] One of the most exciting groups of drug candidates within this class are membrane‐disruptive, antiviral peptides that inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses in order to abrogate viral infectivity.[88] Several antiviral peptides have been discovered that inhibit a wide range of membrane‐enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)[89] and HIV,[90] and include a 27‐mer amphipathic, α‐helical (AH) peptide that exhibits membrane‐curvature‐selective disruptive activity to inhibit small, membrane‐enveloped virus particles of ≈160 nm diameter or smaller.[91] In vitro antiviral testing experiments against various types of membrane‐enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have been conducted using a wide range of permissive, model cell lines such as Vero cells and human liver‐derived Huh 7.5 cells as well as primary cells such as mouse neuronal cells and human T cells. The results have demonstrated that some membrane‐active peptides exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses down to the nanomolar range along with low cell cytotoxicity.[92] While viral envelopes are derived from host cell membranes, the AH peptide and possibly other peptides can exhibit selective rupture of highly curved viral membranes due to membrane‐curvature‐triggered membrane disruption.[93] Indeed, mammalian cells are much larger than virus particles and hence possess an appreciably lower degree of membrane curvature and this curvature difference provides a distinguishing factor between viral and mammalian cell membranes.[94] These promising mechanistic features have motivated researchers to explore how to utilize viral‐membrane‐targeting, antiviral peptides in vivo, while exploring design strategies to overcome traditional challenges of peptide therapeutics, such as high susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and short circulation time.[95] To overcome these challenges, Jackman et al. explored the development of an engineered version of the AH peptide, composed of all D‐amino acids and termed AH‐D, which was able to therapeutically treat lethal Zika virus infection in a mouse model in vivo.[92] The basic design concept was called lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD) and posited that extracellular targeting of membrane‐enveloped viruses can reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in order to help curb viral infection (Figure 6a). Upon intravenous administration of the AH‐D peptide starting 3 days post‐virus inoculation, over 80% of mice survived Zika virus infection and exhibited markedly reduced clinical symptoms in general. Importantly, the AH‐D peptide was able to significantly reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in the blood as well as in multiple organs, including in the brain (Figure 6b). More extensive studies revealed that the AH‐D peptide is able to cross the intact blood‐brain barrier to treat Zika virus infection directly in the brain as well as to reduce infection‐related brain inflammation (Figure 6c,d).

From a material science perspective, another noteworthy point is that a large portion of the mechanistic understanding about how AH and AH‐D peptides work has been obtained from biosensing measurement strategies involving biomimetic, virus‐particle‐mimicking vesicles in combination with acoustic‐, optical‐, nanoplasmonic‐, and fluorescence‐microscopy‐based techniques.[91, 96] Examples include nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and plasmonic nanohole sensors[97] (Figure 6e–i). Such insights have led to further exploration of the AH‐D peptide as an antiviral drug candidate to prevent Zika virus infection of fetuses in pregnant mice[98] and forward‐looking discussion about how the LEAD concept could be useful for broadly treating mosquito‐borne virus infections, including not only Zika but also Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever among various possibilities.[99] This capability could be especially beneficial when a mosquito‐borne viral infection is clinically suspected but a differential diagnosis of the specific virus type is challenging.[100] The LEAD concept might be generally applicable to other types of membrane‐enveloped viruses as well since the viral membrane represents an Achilles heel and there is a high barrier to the emergence of drug‐resistant strains because the viral membrane is derived from host cell membranes and not encoded within the viral genome.[101] It has even been suggested that membrane‐enveloped SARS‐CoV‐2 might be susceptible to viral membrane disruption[102] and these aspects are particularly important because SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the brain has been linked to a wide range of COVID‐19 disease conditions.[103] While intravenously administered, antiviral peptides have demonstrated initial promise in some mouse models of viral infections, nanomaterial‐based drug delivery strategies could improve pharmacological activities and lead to improved targeting possibilities. Zhang et al. have reported the development of a cationic, membrane‐active antiviral peptide that was mixed together with anionic polymer chains to form ≈35 nm diameter nanoparticles.[104] These peptide‐polymer nanoparticles exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against HCV infection of Huh 7.5 cells and HIV infection of TZM‐bl cells, human lymphocytes, and monocyte‐derived macrophages, respectively, and also showed lower levels of hemolytic activity against red blood cells than the free peptide alone. Intramuscular injection of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles showed improved treatment of HIV‐1 infection in a mouse model in vivo, as compared to free peptide alone. In a follow‐up study, a refined version of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles was developed that was functionalized with galactosyl sugar molecules in order to enable improved HepG2 cell internalization in vitro and preferential liver accumulation in mice in vivo.[105] Ongoing work can further expand the potential of targeting membrane‐enveloped viruses by using antiviral peptides and other classes of small‐molecule inhibitors[106] that impair viral membrane‐associated proteins to prevent virus‐cell fusion in combination with nanomaterial strategies to enhance targeted delivery prospects. In addition to directly targeting virus particles, it might be possible to also disrupt membrane‐enveloped exosomes that carry viral components such as nucleic acids and proteins and can be involved in viral infection and transmission processes.[107]

6 Virus‐Removing Blood Filters Another approach to effectively remove circulating virus particles from the blood of infected hosts has relied on the use of extracorporeal blood‐filtering devices and advances upon medical device technology that was originally used to treat sepsis infections.[108] Early work by Kang et al. demonstrated that a microfluidic device can effectively remove a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood.[109] To achieve this objective, ≈130 nm diameter magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) protein molecules, which can bind to sugar molecules found on the surface of various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses along with endotoxins.[110] The MBL‐functionalized nanoparticles were mixed together with circulating blood, could bind to circulating pathogens, and then the nanoparticle‐pathogen mixtures could be magnetically separated before the blood was returned to the host. In rat models of bacterial infection, more than 90% of bacteria were reduced along with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Seiler et al. have further explored the use of an engineered version of MBL that demonstrated improved pathogen capture in blood and urine samples.[111] Based on these findings, there has been ongoing progress to develop extracorporeal blood filters for virus particle removal applications as well. Tullis et al. demonstrated that hemodialysis treatment using a hollow‐fiber cartridge that contained antibody‐functionalized agarose beads could effectively remove HIV‐1 virus particles and viral proteins from cell culture media and blood.[112] These capabilities have led to the exploration of clinical‐stage medical device technology to broadly capture a wide range of circulating virus particles by replacing the antibody functionalization with MBL functionalization. Early reports indicated preliminary testing success to capture HIV and HCV virus particles along with binding to Dengue, influenza, Ebola, and Marburg viral proteins.[113] A pilot human clinical trial using a full‐scale version of this medical device technology was used to remove HCV from the blood of 4 HCV‐positive patients and resulted in an average drop in HCV viral loads of around 57%.[114] Follow‐up studies showed HCV viral load reductions in additional patients and it was further suggested that continuous application of this treatment approach could potentially reduce HCV to clinically undetectable levels within a few days, especially if used in combination with conventional antiviral drug therapies.[115] Büttner et al. have also reported that the medical device technology has been used to treat one patient with Ebola virus infection[116] and recent works have explored how these extracorporeal blood filters might be useful to remove coronaviruses and Marburg virus from infected blood.[117] With respect to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it has also been noted that virus‐removing blood filters could be a useful technology.[118] Given the small number of patients in the aforementioned clinical testing, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present stage, however, there are bright prospects to continue exploring virus‐removing blood filter technology. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the initiation of a feasibility study, with up to 40 human patients, to test the treatment efficacy of an extracorporeal blood filter based on this medical device technology for patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis and severe COVID‐19 disease.[119] In terms of future innovation in this direction, it is important to continue exploring how to develop improved filtration devices while also creating new biofunctionalization strategies to improve virus‐binding capacity and perhaps apply peptide functionalization schemes to catalytically damage virus particles as opposed to intact virus particle binding alone. Looking forward, these medical device technologies can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antiviral drug therapies to lower the amount of infectious virus particles in blood while also inhibiting the production of new virus particles among other possibilities.

7 Virus‐Mimicking Nanoparticle Vaccines 7.1 Design Rationale There has also been tremendous progress in developing nanoparticle‐based vaccine strategies to prevent and treat viral infections. In general, viral infections provoke the immune system, which can recognize viral proteins on the virus particle surface (“antigens”) and produce antibodies that bind to these antigens to neutralize virus particles.[120] In some cases, natural antibodies produced in response to a viral infection can have extremely high specificity and potency to inhibit virus particles.[121] For these reasons, the blood plasma from patients who recover from a certain type of virus infection is often given as a medical treatment to infected patients afflicted with the same type of virus infection.[122] In such cases, the plasma can contain high levels of neutralizing antibodies that bind to and inhibit virus particles.[123] However, the specific types and concentrations of antibodies present in blood plasma vary from person‐to‐person, potentially limiting reliable clinical use.[124] Hence, there has been extensive interest in recombinantly manufacturing specific, highly potent neutralizing antibodies as an alternative treatment option.[125] This latter approach allows more precise control over antibody composition and dosing. Recombinant antibody therapies also reduce the risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, which can arise in some cases from non‐neutralizing antibodies that are also present in plasma.[125, 126] The same logic applies to vaccine development where the key objective is to administer a virus‐mimicking immunogenic material so that a strong and focused immune response can be trained. The target objective is to generate high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies while minimizing production of non‐neutralizing antibodies that can otherwise inadvertently promote virus infection in some cases. Over the past few years, virus‐mimicking nanomaterial design strategies have been at the forefront of creating next‐generation vaccine strategies now reaching human clinical trials. The combination of nanomaterials, biomimetics, and protein engineering has led to unprecedented capabilities to rationally finetune immune responses and elicit high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies in a safe and effective manner. These capabilities are currently being extended to develop a nanoparticle vaccine candidate to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Recent progress in the field highlights the merits of both natural and engineered protein scaffolds to create self‐assembling, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines with excellent biomechanical and immunological properties. The fast‐moving progress on this subject is reviewed in this section along with coverage of other vaccine nanoparticle strategies. 7.2 Types of Nanoparticle Vaccines There is broad interest in integrating material science and protein engineering strategies to develop safe, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines that present viral protein antigens in a highly organized and symmetrical manner in order to induce strong immune responses.[127] Compared to free antigens, nanoparticle vaccines have several compelling advantages, including greater antigen stability, multivalent presentation of antigens, and targeted delivery.[128] As such, nanoparticle vaccines can bind multivalently to multiple receptors on B cells, which are immune cells involved in antibody production, resulting in more robust immune responses and high levels of immune protection.[24] A wide variety of nanoparticle types are being explored to prevent infectious diseases in general, including self‐assembling protein nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomal nanoparticles, and polymer scaffolds.[129] Key design considerations include optimizing the antigen structure (more precisely, the immunogen structure) to elicit the desired immune response, tuning vaccine delivery, and inducing focused immune responses.[130] From a biomimetic perspective, one of the most promising recent design advances has involved self‐assembled nanoparticle vaccines as discussed below along with introducing other nanoparticle vaccine design strategies. 7.2.1 Natural Protein Scaffolds The earliest example of a natural protein scaffold to form a nanoparticle vaccine involved the use of ferritin, which self‐assembles into nearly spherical, hollow nanoparticles that have ≈12 nm core diameter and are composed of 24 protein molecules with symmetrical organization.[131] By overcoming several challenges related to protein glycosylation and oligomerization, Kanekiyo et al. first reported the design of a ferritin‐based, influenza nanoparticle vaccine in 2013 that presented eight trimers of influenza HA viral protein on the nanoparticle surface in a native‐like configuration that enabled a superior immune response to conventionally used influenza vaccine strategies based on inactivated virus particles.[132] From a material science perspective, the key innovation was controlling the location at which ferritin and HA were genetically fused together in order to recombinantly express ferritin‐HA fusion proteins that self‐assembled into nanoparticles with repetitively spaced, trimeric HA spikes (Figure 7a,b). Ferritin‐HA nanoparticle immunization induced a strong immune response, as indicated by high levels of neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza H1N1 strains and protection against influenza virus infection in a ferret model (Figure 7c,d). Recently, Kelly et al. have elucidated how ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccination in mice triggers principally germinal center expansion and maturation of memory B cells, which are involved in antibody production.[133] In another study, Yassine et al. further explored the development of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines that presented a truncated version of HA, which corresponded to the stem region that is conserved across different HA subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and hence its trimeric presentation on the nanoparticle surface conferred protection against a wider range of influenza subtypes in mouse and ferret models.[134] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ).

Ferritin nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed to prevent infections from viruses such as HIV‐1 and Sliepen et al. first reported the design of ferritin nanoparticles presenting HIV‐1 envelope (Env) protein trimers, which demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity in mice and rabbits.[136] Neutralizing antibodies were generated to inhibit some but not all HIV‐1 strains, and it was particularly challenging to inhibit certain strains classified as “difficult‐to‐neutralize”.[137] It was discussed how the nanoparticle design might be improved by reducing steric hindrance between adjacent Env trimers. He et al. refined the structure‐based design of the trimeric Env antigens presented on the ferritin nanoparticle surface along with optimizing spacing between the trimers in order to yield more robust B cell responses.[138] More detailed engineering of the Env antigen structure increased Env trimer recognition on the ferritin nanoparticles by a broader range of naïve B cells, resulting in elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.[139] Due to the high sequence variation among Env proteins across different HIV‐1 strains, Sliepen et al. have designed a new Env antigen structure based on a consequence sequence incorporating the epitopes of many broadly neutralizing antibodies, and presented the Env antigen trimers on ferritin nanoparticles to yield strong neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits and macaques.[140] In addition, He et al. have reported additional protein engineering efforts to improve the stability of wild‐type Env antigens by switching out the ectodomain with a more stable version from an engineered Env antigen, which enabled improved generation of neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit difficult‐to‐neutralize HIV‐1 strains, in mice and rabbits.[141] Together, the ongoing work with ferritin‐Env nanoparticle vaccines to prevent HIV‐1 infection demonstrates the superior immune responses generated by antigen trimers on the nanoparticle surface, while highlighting the potential to combine these nanomaterial efforts with antigen‐based protein engineering efforts. Such possibilities have also been explored for a wide range of other viruses and support the broad versatility of ferritin nanoparticle technology for developing next‐generation vaccines. Kanekiyo et al. have designed a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) infection by conjugating ferritin molecules to a truncated domain from the EBV gp350 protein that contains the receptor‐binding site needed for B cell infection.[142] On the ferritin nanoparticle surface, the antigen formed dimers, which is a distinct conformation to the trimeric presentation cases discussed above. Importantly, compared to the soluble gp350 antigen, the nanoparticle vaccine still elicited markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies by 10‐ to 100‐fold in mice and nonhuman primates and also conferred protective immunity on mice in a lethal virus challenge model. Bu et al. have also developed another form of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent EBV infection based on a different antigen (gH), which alone and in complexation with gL and gp42 proteins helps to generate neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus‐cell fusion and works against multiple cell types instead of only preventing B cell infection.[143] In another important example, Wang et al. have reported a dual‐targeting, ferritin nanoparticle vaccine strategy to prevent and treat chronic HBV infection in mice based on activating two types of immune cells to induce high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibodies.[144] Recent work has further demonstrated that ferritin nanoparticles are an excellent platform to present viral antigens for developing HCV vaccines that might work against a wide range of HCV genotypes[145] and also to develop vaccines for treating RSV infection.[146] Notably, in the latter case, a glycosylated version of the RSV antigen was designed that induced a higher ratio of neutralizing antibodies to non‐neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates, which could be significant because higher levels of non‐neutralizing antibodies are thought to be associated with antibody‐mediated disease enhancement.[146] In addition to fabricating ferritin nanoparticles composed of one type of building block component, there has been interest in developing two‐component ferritin nanoparticles in order to present oligomers of multiple antigens on the nanoparticle surface. For example, Georgiev et al. reported the development of ferritin nanoparticles composed of two types of ferritin constructs, one of which was fused to an influenza virus antigen and the other one of which was fused to an HIV‐1 antigen, and nanoparticle self‐assembly resulted in trimeric presentation of both antigens.[147] Importantly, vaccination with this nanoparticle strategy in guinea pigs could induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibited both viruses. Since there are many different subtypes of influenza virus, Kanekiyo et al. expanded on this nanoparticle design strategy to design and coassemble ferritin‐HA constructs encoding HA with one of two receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) and the resulting nanoparticles had mosaic HA trimers that presented a mixture of RBDs to yield a broader antibody response than nanoparticles with either RBD alone.[148] Vaccination in mice led to the discovery of a neutralizing antibody that works against a wide range of influenza virus strains. Accordingly, nanoparticle‐based strategies presenting multiple antigens have been suggested as one possible route to create a universal influenza vaccine.[25] While ferritin nanoparticles have proven useful for creating vaccine nanoparticle technology, there has been extensive interest in identifying other natural protein scaffolds that can self‐assemble into nanoparticles with different sizes. Also in 2013, Jardine et al. reported the development of ≈32 nm diameter, self‐assembling nanoparticles composed of 60 recombinantly expressed lumazine synthase (LS) protein molecules from Aquifex aeolicus, which exhibit symmetrical organization, and designed an LS fusion protein together with HIV‐1 Env antigen that could form nanoparticles with enhanced B cell activation and lymph node trafficking properties.[149] In follow‐up work, an improved version of the LS nanoparticle vaccine platform was designed and induced promising immune responses in different mouse models in vivo, toward the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV‐1 infection.[150] Havenar‐Daughton et al. further investigated single‐dose immunization of rhesus monkeys with this HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccine and noted that subcutaneous immunization yielded markedly larger B cell responses and lymph node drainage than intramuscular drainage.[151] Tokatlian et al. have also explored how antigen glycosylation of LS‐ and ferritin‐based HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines is an important factor in modulating antibody responses (Figure 7e,f).[135] The results demonstrated that antigen glycosylation is an important factor in eliciting high levels of antigen‐specific antibody levels and appreciably lower levels were observed with deglycosylated antigen (Figure 7g). Additionally, Krebs et al. have investigated ≈23 nm diameter nanoparticle self‐assembly from the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in order to create nanoparticle vaccines presenting an HIV‐1 Env antigen fragment, which yielded an antigen‐specific antibody in immunized rabbits although multiple rounds of immunization were needed to elicit moderately protective, neutralizing antibody levels in a large fraction of rabbits.[152] As seen in these examples, it is important to point out that self‐assembled nanoparticles from different natural protein scaffolds have distinct functionalities, as noted by how protein scaffolds fused together with full‐length viral protein antigens can only self‐assemble into nanoparticles for some, but not all, of the scaffold options and antigen spacing is another important factor affecting both nanoparticle self‐assembly and immunogenicity.[138] In part, such design issues have motivated the use of full‐length viral proteins or truncated versions thereof and the type of nanoparticle structure can also affect antigen oligomerization in some cases.[142] Another important point concerns the nanoparticle vaccine fabrication strategy. To date, the structural components of virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines have been recombinantly expressed in host cells in vitro and, upon expression, spontaneously self‐assemble into antigen‐presenting nanoparticles. In such cases, the nanoparticle vaccine suspension is then injected into animals as part of the immunization process. As an alternative strategy, recent work has also investigated nucleic‐acid‐based vaccination strategies that could enable the in vivo expression of nanoparticle structural components and, in some cases, in vivo self‐assembly of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. Melo et al. reported the development of a lipid‐nanoparticle‐encapsulated alphavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) replicon encoding the HIV Env antigen fused with LS.[153] A single injection of this lipid nanoparticle suspension encoding the HIV Env antigen yielded high levels of Env‐specific antibodies and also led to improved B cell responses compared to recombinant protein immunization. In another demonstration, Xu et al. reported the use of a DNA vaccine plasmid to induce the in vivo expression of a nanoparticle structural component comprising an HIV Env antigen fused with LS, and demonstrated its in vivo structural assembly in mice based on functional studies along with improved immune responses in mice and guinea pigs compared to immunization with a similar delivery strategy encoding antigen monomers only.[154] The design concept was further generalized to other natural protein scaffolds, such as ferritin nanoparticles, which also induced high immune responses and the delivery strategy could also be adapted to influenza HA antigen in order to endow mice with protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge. From a translational perspective, there has been tremendous progress in developing ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccines for preventing influenza infections based on ongoing human clinical trials being conducted in the United States. Preliminary data from the first‐in‐human trial (NCT03186781) of a ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccine provided initial evidence that the vaccine is safe and well‐tolerated in humans while another human clinical trial (NCT03814720) is ongoing to evaluate the dosing, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ferritin‐HA‐stem nanoparticles as a potential universal flu vaccine candidate. 7.2.2 Engineered Protein Scaffolds The insights gained from nanoparticle vaccines based on self‐assembling natural protein scaffolds have highlighted the importance of tuning antigen structure, conformation, density, and spacing on the nanoparticle surface. While several types of self‐assembling proteins exist in nature, the number of options is intrinsically limited, which has prompted researchers to further explore the design of nanoparticle vaccines from self‐assembling, engineered protein scaffolds that enable greater control over nanomaterial properties. Toward this goal, King et al. reported computational strategies to design 24‐subunit protein nanomaterials composed of two types of self‐assembling protein subunit components, and experimentally demonstrated that it was possible to rationally tune the nanomaterial structure, shape, and symmetry in alignment with the computational designs.[155] In another study, Bale et al. applied similar approaches to design larger, two‐component protein nanomaterials composed of 120 subunits with icosahedral symmetry and had 24–40 nm diameters that are similar to the size of small viral capsids.[156] Another advantage of using two‐component engineered proteins is greater control over the fabrication process. Natural protein scaffolds self‐assemble upon recombinant expression while engineered protein components can be expressed independently and then mixed as desired to self‐assemble into nanoparticles in vitro. Marcandalli et al. reported the first example of an engineered‐protein‐based nanoparticle vaccine that was built from two self‐assembling components and presented multiple copies of a trimeric RSV envelope antigen termed DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8a,b).[157] One protein component was designed to present DS‐Cav1 and spontaneously formed trimers by itself, while the other protein component formed pentamers by itself. The two protein components were expressed independently and, when mixed together in vitro, 20 trimers of the first protein component and 12 pentamers of the second protein component self‐assembled to form two‐component nanoparticles with ≈55 nm diameter inclusive of the antigen trimer spikes. Unlike previous nanoparticle vaccine designs, it was possible to control the density of DS‐Cav1 antigen trimer on the nanoparticle surface based on mixing different amounts of the first protein component with a genetically fused version of the first protein component that presents DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8c). Importantly, the nanoparticle presentation of DS‐Cav1 trimers not only improved antigen physical stability but also nanoparticle vaccine immunization in mice and nonhuman primates led to nearly 10‐fold higher neutralizing antibody titers along with a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response than immunization with soluble DS‐Cav1 trimers (Figure 8d). Brouwer et al. have also used a similar two‐component nanoparticle strategy to present HIV‐1 envelope antigen trimers.[158] In this case, the two‐component nanoparticle induced particularly high antibody responses after a single round of immunization, as compared to the same antigen trimers in soluble form and displayed on single‐component ferritin nanoparticles. There is ongoing exploration of different nanoparticle shape designs[159] and how nanoparticle formulations can improve lymph node targeting in nonhuman primate models.[160] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ) and the bar indicates the geometric mean, which is listed for each test group.

In terms of COVID‐19 vaccine development, Walls et al. recently reported the development of a two‐component nanoparticle vaccine candidate that displays the RBD of a SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope protein antigen (Figure 8e).[161] From a nanomaterial design perspective, a key innovation was introducing a genetically encoded flexible linker to connect the smaller RBD domain with the main nanoparticle structure. It is also noteworthy that the basic self‐assembling nanoparticle design involved the same two protein components as in the RSV and HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines described above, demonstrating the modular nature of nanoparticle vaccines and the ability to rationally swap antigens to support rapid vaccine development (Figure 8f). Importantly, the COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine induced nearly ten‐fold greater neutralizing antibody titers in mice than a soluble antigen trimer even when the nanoparticles were administered at a five‐time lower dose (Figure 8g). The nanoparticle vaccine also induced a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response, as compared to human convalescent sera. This immune response resulted in complete protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an in vivo virus challenge mouse model (Figure 8h). The combination of these features has further spurred ongoing manufacturing efforts to create a COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine in abundant quantities for potential human clinical trials. Looking forward, Ueda et al. have also continued designing new nanoparticle vaccine designs that are tailored for different types of viral protein domains[157] and there is excellent potential to continue exploring protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. As control over the molecular‐level biomimetic features of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines continues to improve, there will be growing emphasis on production scalability and how these nanoparticle vaccines can compete with other vaccine candidates in terms of practical factors such as cost, storage, and scalability. 7.2.3 Additional Scaffold Options While there has been tremendous progress in developing protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines to prevent viral infections, liposome‐ and inorganic nanoparticle‐based strategies have also proven advantageous and demonstrate important nanomaterial desi

Biomimetic Nanomaterial Strategies for Virus Targeting: Antiviral Therapies and VaccinesBiomimetic nanomaterials have excellent potential to combat viral infections and lay the groundwork for next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines. There is ongoing progress to develop nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, virus‐binding na…The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic highlights the importance of developing effective virus targeting strategies to treat and prevent viral infections. Since virus particles are nanoscale entities, nanomaterial design strategies are ideally suited to create advanced materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles. In this progress report, the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials are critically discussed for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Particular focus is placed on nanomaterial design concepts and material innovations that can be readily developed to thwart future viral threats. Pertinent nanomaterial examples from the COVID‐19 situation are also covered along with discussion of human clinical trial efforts underway that might lead to next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there have been growing calls to recognize that emerging infectious diseases represent a major threat to global health and that we must be better prepared to deal with a future viral pandemic, which could arise from an unknown or understudied virus.[1] In 2018, the World Health Organization expanded on these viewpoints by preparing a list of viral and nonviral pathogens that could cause Disease X, a future human disease outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential that would be triggered by a newly emerged pathogen.[2] In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic arose as the first Disease X and was caused by the global spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has infected over 39 million people and caused over 1 100 000 deaths to date.[3] COVID‐19 is considered by some experts to be a once‐in‐a‐century pandemic[4] and has highlighted how viral pandemics can create a perfect storm of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that is disrupting the institutions of daily life worldwide, including work, healthcare, education, and transportation.[5] Our understanding of COVID‐19 continues to grow since a local outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and led to the discovery of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is related to other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[6] SARS‐CoV‐2 is believed to be a zoonotic virus that crossed over from bats[7] and acquired mutations via natural selection that caused the virus to more efficiently infect human cells and transmit among humans.[8] Early reports of human respiratory disease[9] have since been followed up by numerous, ongoing studies to gain further insight into COVID‐19 disease pathogenesis, including how severe cases of COVID‐19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.[10] Various organs are affected by the disease, including lungs,[11] heart,[12] liver,[13] kidney,[14] and brain.[15] As such, there has been tremendous attention placed on the treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and growing attention to the role that materials science can play in stopping COVID‐19 and, more broadly, the wide range of viral infections affecting global society along with future viral threats.[16] The objective of this progress report is to cover the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Major emphasis is placed on covering the most recent developments mainly within the past three years, while distilling key nanomaterial design principles that can lead to next‐generation advanced materials for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Where applicable, we also discuss how these nanomaterial strategies are being explored to stop SARS‐CoV‐2 along with coverage of relevant human clinical trial efforts.

2 Advanced Materials for Virus Targeting Virus particles (“virions”) are biological nanoparticles that contain viral genetic material and are surrounded by a protein or lipid bilayer membrane coating. The particles are typically around 50–300 nm in diameter and are functionalized with glycoproteins that play an important role in binding to cells.[17] There are two main types: enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Membrane‐enveloped viruses are surrounded by a host‐cell‐derived lipid membrane that contains embedded glycoproteins while nonenveloped viruses have a protein‐based capsid shell without lipid membrane.[18] In both cases, the glycoproteins on the virus particle surface are the major antigens, which are recognized by the host immune system and can elicit an antibody response.[19] Once the immune system is trained to recognize a viral antigen, the immune system can rapidly produce antibodies that bind to the virus particles and prevent them from causing infection.[20] Fundamentally, virus particles are parasites that must infect susceptible cells and highjack cellular machinery in order to produce new virus particles.[21] The basic steps are presented in Scheme 1a. The first step involves virus particle binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface, which can result in cellular entry and start of the infection process. Each type of cell has a characteristic pattern of receptors found on the cellular surface and different viruses bind preferentially to particular ones. For example, many viruses bind specifically to glycan‐functionalized receptors containing sulfonate or sialyl functional groups. Infected cells produce new copies of viral genetic material and viral proteins, which are then assembled in order to produce new virus particles that are released extracellularly and infect new cells. The process continues indefinitely until an organism succumbs to virus‐induced cellular damage and related immune responses, and viruses can also spread between organisms via a wide range of transmission mechanisms. Scheme 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Biomimetic nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. a) Overview of virus life cycle. Viruses cannot replicate independently and must infect cells. The replication machinery of infected cells is highjacked by viruses and used to create new copies of the viral genome and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles that are released from the cell and spread to infect other cells. b) Examples of different nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. i) Nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors can inhibit the production of new virus particles. ii) Virus‐binding nanoparticles and iii) cell membrane decoys can bind to virus particles and prevent viral infection of cells. iv) Viral membrane inhibitors can disrupt membrane‐enveloped virus particles, abrogating infectivity. v) Extracorporeal blood filters can remove circulating virus particles from the bloodstream to reduce disease burden. vi) Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines that mimic the multivalent presentation of antigens on virus particle surfaces can elicit improved immune responses that lead to greater protection against future virus exposure. Depending on the objective, various nanomaterial strategies can be useful to stop viruses, as presented in Scheme 1b. Conventionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to inhibit viral genome replication inside infected cells, thereby preventing the production of new virus particles.[22] Nanomaterial strategies have proven useful to enhance the pharmacological properties of viral genome replication inhibitors, including circulation time. While it is advantageous to stop viral genome replication in order to help treat existing viral infections, there is also extensive interest in exploring how nanomaterials can be useful to prevent viral infections.[23] Virus‐binding nanomaterials can attach to virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells. Pristine nanomaterials can be used along with receptor‐functionalized ones and cell‐membrane‐decoy nanomaterials, which are coated with cell membrane extracts containing natural receptors. Ongoing efforts have also devised nanomaterial‐based strategies to effectively remove extracellular virus particles from infected organisms by either selectively disrupting virus particles or by removing them through extracorporeal filtration strategies. Moreover, some of the most recent and innovative advances have come from developing nanoparticle vaccines, especially self‐assembling protein‐based ones, which have demonstrated excellent potential to prevent multiple types of viral infections.[24] One of the most promising candidates has been rapidly advanced into human clinical trials as a potential universal flu vaccine[25] and similar strategies are now being applied to SARS‐CoV‐2. A key innovative aspect of these nanoparticle vaccines is that critical architectural properties of virus particles, particularly the specific organization of glycoprotein antigens, can now be mimicked with nanoscale precision and these advanced material capabilities have led to nanoparticle vaccine candidates with superior immunizing capabilities to currently used vaccine strategies in some cases. The latest progress in all of these areas is covered in the following sections.

3 Viral Replication Inhibitors The most widely used class of direct‐acting antiviral drugs encompasses small molecules that inhibit the genome replication of viruses inside infected cells.[26] These replication processes involve a multiprotein replication complex called the viral replicase[27] and antiviral therapy often targets one or more types of the viral proteins that form this complex. Key examples of antiviral drugs in this class include nucleoside and nucleotide analogues that inhibit the viral polymerase, which is the main enzyme involved in viral genome production.[28] Over the years, there have been extensive efforts to develop prodrugs[29]—inactive molecules that are metabolized into the active drug in vivo—and drug delivery systems that enable longer circulation time, targeted delivery, and/or improved safety of viral replication inhibitors, in line with broader innovation trends in the nanomedicine field as a whole. Promising examples include development of a once weekly, orally administered antiviral drug delivery platform that consists of several polymer matrices with different drug release profiles in order to consistently maintain pharmaceutically relevant concentrations of antiviral drugs in systemic circulation.[30] One of the most recent examples of cutting‐edge nanomaterial strategies to deliver viral replication inhibitors involves the class of macromolecular prodrugs, comprising polymer‐functionalized antiviral drugs in complexation with serum proteins. Andersen et al. described the formation of polymer–protein–drug complexes that enable long‐duration therapy with multiple antiviral drugs.[31] A polymer–protein complex comprised of a single, ≈7 kDa N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (PHPMA) chain per covalently attached albumin molecule was designed and exhibited much longer circulation half‐time and higher concentrations in mice upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as compared to free PHPMA alone. Marked accumulation of the polymer–protein complex in mouse lymph nodes was also reported. Two antiviral drugs, azidothymidine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), were covalently incorporated into the monomer backbone via a labile disulfide linkage for eventual intracellular release of free drug molecules. These functionalized building blocks were assembled into a colloidal‐like polymer–protein–drug complex consisting of one polymer chain with six AZT and four 3TC copies along with one albumin molecule and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human T cells in vitro. Frich et al. expanded on this macromolecular prodrug strategy by devising a “hitchhiking” scheme in which a polymer–drug conjugate was fabricated and exhibited noncovalent binding to serum albumin proteins, as indicated by biophysical experiments and increased circulation half‐time in mice in vivo.[32] The key innovation was functionalizing the PHPMA component with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) lipid, which is a binding ligand for serum albumin proteins found in circulation (Figure 1a). A polymer–drug conjugate was synthesized consisting of DSPE–PHPMA and multiple copies of acyclovir (ACV), which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpes simplex virus (HSV). It was verified that free ACV could be released from the DSPE–PHPMA–ACV complex upon incubation in physiologically relevant conditions containing glutathione (GSH). It was determined that >100 × 10−9 m ACV was released within 3 h from 1 g L–1 PHPMA–ACV in GSH‐containing phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) while nearly negligible release was observed over an appreciably longer time period of 24 h in PBS without GSH. Importantly, DSPE–PHPMA–ACV also exhibited antiviral activity against HSV type 2 (HSV‐2) infection of baby hamster kidney‐derived ELVIS and human cervix‐derived HeLa cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous administration of the polymer–drug complex helped to suppress vaginal HSV‐2 infection in an in vivo mouse model based on viral infectivity measurements of vaginal wash and spinal cord specimens (Figure 1b). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) and poly(N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (PHPMA) to form the DSPE‐PHPMA‐ACV complex. DSPE‐PHPMA was found to bind noncovalently to serum albumin proteins, which was associated with a longer circulation half‐time in mice. By contrast, PHPMA alone did not bind appreciably to albumins. b) Effect of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered DSPE‐PHPMA‐ACV, PHPMA‐ACV, free ACV, and no treatment (N.t.) on vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2) infection in an in vivo mouse model. The equivalent dose of ACV was fixed at 60 mg kg–1. The data show the virus amount in vaginal wash collected on day 2 postinfection and in the spinal cord (medulla spinalis) on day 7 postinfection, respectively. The data are expressed in plaque‐forming units (PFU) mL–1 wash sample or g–1 spinal cord tissue. Each data point corresponds to an individual mouse.

In addition to forming polymer–drug complexes, recent efforts have focused on creating macromolecular prodrugs from chemical derivatives of nucleoside analogues that can form nucleic acid scaffolds. For example, Krüger et al. demonstrated that idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to treat HSV infection, could be converted into a phosphoramidite derivative and then these building blocks were used to synthesize linear nucleic acid scaffolds with 7 or 14 attached drug molecules (Figure 1c).[33] In vitro release experiments revealed that the scaffolds are stable in serum‐free cell culture medium while free idoxuridine was gradually released within 2–6 h in the presence of serum, indicating the potential utility of these scaffolds for in vivo applications (Figure 1d). Future work needs to continue exploring the prophylactic and therapeutic utility of macromolecular prodrugs of viral replication inhibitors in animal models, while there exist numerous potential advantages in terms of well‐defined colloidal properties and targeted codelivery of two or more antiviral drugs to increase the barrier for drug‐resistant virus strains to emerge.[34] There also remains an outstanding need to investigate the mechanisms of drug release in vivo and to also continue exploring how macromolecular prodrugs can be engineered to target specific organs.

4 Virus Particle Binding Inhibitors 4.1 Pristine Nanomaterials Over the years, various classes of nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based nanomaterials have been synthesized and there are well‐developed methods to control atomic composition, size, and functional groups. Accordingly, systematic studies have long been conducted to test how different types of pristine nanomaterials—as‐synthesized nanomaterials without additional surface functionalization—affect virus particles and have revealed a variety of antiviral mechanisms related to virus particle binding and steric blocking, chemical reactions involving nanomaterial‐induced reactive species, and virus particle disruption, as extensively covered in numerous reviews.[35] To date, however, most of these antiviral activities have been characterized in vitro, while it is more challenging to use pristine nanomaterials in vivo where they can show diminished antiviral activity. Key challenges include nonspecific binding of nanomaterials to other biological components and the protein corona that can form spontaneously on nanomaterial surfaces upon immersion in physiological environments.[36] In addition to conventional nanomaterial options, there has also been extensive interest in designing nanomaterials from poorly soluble antimicrobial compounds, which can improve solubility and potential usability in some cases. For example, Huang et al. reported the fabrication of water‐dispersible, benzoxazine monomer‐derived carbon dots with ≈4 nm diameter, which inhibited a wide range of viruses, including Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and Dengue (Figure 2a).[37] Significant reductions in viral infectivity in vitro against baby hamster kidney‐derived BHK‐21 and monkey kidney‐derived Vero cells were observed upon pretreatment of virus particles with the carbon dots (Figure 2b,c). Another study involved the fabrication of water‐dispersible, glycyrrhizic acid‐derived carbon dots that inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of nonhuman primate‐derived MARC‐145, Vero, and pig kidney‐derived PK‐15 cells by suppressing viral genome replication and stimulating innate immune responses.[38] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint –1 BZM‐CDs.

Taking inspiration from how a wide range of biological materials have spiky surfaces for increased adhesion, one of the most recent advances has been the development of spiky nanostructures that have improved contact with virus particles (Figure 2d). Based on the complex topology of spherical influenza virus particles, including the presence of protruding glycoproteins, Nie et al. fabricated spiky silica nanoparticles that exhibited improved adhesion to the virus particles, as compared to smooth silica nanoparticles (Figure 2e).[39] The spike dimensions were optimized so that the nanoparticle spikes could fit well in between the glycoprotein protrusions (Figure 2f,g). Notably, however, the spiky silica nanoparticles had low aqueous dispersibility, so they were initially coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) but did not inhibit influenza virus infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK‐II cells in vitro. Therefore, the spiky silica nanoparticles were coated with a red blood cell membrane extract, which facilitated antiviral activity in vitro, as indicated by reduced virus particle binding to cells and decreased viral infectivity. Cell membrane coatings are further discussed in Section 4.3 below and this example provides insight into how the biological functionality of nanomaterials can be modulated based on the surface coating. A combination of binding ligands and antiviral drugs was further conjugated on the spiky nanoparticle surface to enhance antiviral activity against influenza virus and inhibit infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro.[40] Porous gold nanoparticles with a high surface area have also been reported to inhibit infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK cells by a wide range of influenza virus strains in vitro.[41] Ultimately, such studies have provided insight into how nanoparticle composition and shape can influence antiviral activity and this research direction has been greatly enhanced in recent years by integrating nanomaterial design together with biomimetic surface functionalization with cell‐mimicking receptors and cell membrane extracts. 4.2 Receptor‐Functionalized Nanomaterials 4.2.1 Sulfonated Nanoparticles Virus particle attachment to cell membrane receptors is a critical first step in the infection process and, for many types of viruses, involves viral protein binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors that are present on cell surfaces.[42] As such, stopping these virus‐cell binding interactions via competitive inhibitors can prevent infection and various classes of sulfonated polysaccharides have been explored, including heparin[43] and heparin‐like molecules[44] along with metal complexes of sulfonated molecules, and exhibit antiviral activity in vitro.[45] Many of these antiviral molecules have been explored as topical microbicides to prevent vaginal transmission of viruses such as HIV, however, none have demonstrated efficacy in late‐stage clinical trials and intracorporeal efficacy is more challenging to achieve.[46] In light of these shortcomings and the potential utility of this biomimetic design concept in principle, there has been extensive interest in developing sulfonated nanoparticles with a well‐controlled, multivalent presentation of sulfonate groups to inhibit susceptible viruses. Baram‐Pinto et al. reported that sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection of Vero cells in vitro by preventing cell entry of virus particles and hence reducing cell‐to‐cell spreading as well.[47] Notably, the sulfonate groups in that study were attached to gold nanoparticles via short‐chain linkers with low conformational flexibility. Cagno et al. further investigated the design of sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles with short‐chain, low‐flexibility and long‐chain, high‐flexibility linkers and discovered that the use of more flexible chains enabled improved antiviral activity in vitro with Vero cells, ex vivo with human epivaginal tissue cultures, and in vivo in mice (Figure 3a).[48] While both types of sulfonate‐functionalized nanoparticles could bind to and inhibit viruses such as HSV‐2, only the nanoparticles with flexible linkers could inhibit viruses upon dilution due to stronger binding interactions and heparin was also inactive (Figure 3b–d). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that nanoparticle‐virus particle interactions in the latter case resulted in virus particle disruption, indicating a virucidal (“virus‐killing”) type of mechanism (Figure 3e–g). Intranasal administration of the sulfonated nanoparticles also prophylactically inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice in vivo.

Sulfonate‐functionalized inorganic nanoparticles as virucidal inhibitors to disrupt virus particles. a) Schematic illustration of nanoparticle strategies to inhibit virus particles that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on cellular surfaces during the infection process. The basic concept is to create biomimetic nanoparticles with sulfonate groups that can tightly bind to virus particles to prevent virus binding to HSPG cell receptors. Top row: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with low‐flexibility 3‐mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES), termed MES‐AuNPs, can bind relatively weakly to virus particles to prevent infection. However, the inhibitory effect of MES‐AuNPs is lost upon dilution and the virus particles remain infective. Bottom: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with high‐flexibility undecanesulfonic acid (MUS), termed MUS‐AuNPs, can bind relatively strongly to virus particles and prevent infection. The inhibitory effect of MUS‐AuNPs is maintained upon dilution and nullifies viral infectivity due to irreversible virus particle disruption.

Building on this work, Zacheo et al. recently explored how controlling the properties of the sulfonated ligands on the gold nanoparticle surface affects the degree of antiviral activity and identified glucose‐ and lactose‐based ligands with virucidal activity against Dengue virus to inhibit infection of Vero and human liver‐derived HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro.[49] Dey et al. have also reported the fabrication of ≈100–200 nm diameter, hydrogel‐like sulfonated nanogel particles and demonstrated that the nanogels can block HSV‐1 infection of monkey kidney‐derived Vero E6 cells in vitro.[50] Importantly, several types of nanogels were designed with different degrees of flexibility and more flexible nanogels showed greater antiviral activity. Cyclodextrin scaffolds functionalized with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids have also exhibited broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against numerous medically important viruses and further testing showed that HSV did not acquire resistance to the sulfonated cyclodextrin scaffolds.[51] The in vitro antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of money kidney‐derived Vero‐CCL81 and Vero E6 cells has been described in at least two recent works,[52] supporting that nanomaterial strategies involving sulfonate groups might be effective antiviral strategies to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 as well. 4.2.2 Sialylated Nanoparticles Different viruses bind to specific types of cell surface receptors as part of the infection process and another key example involves the influenza virus, which is a leading cause of respiratory viral infections.[53] Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins on the influenza virus particle surface bind to sialic acid‐containing glycan molecules that are prevalent on the surface of human lung cells as well as those of different animal species.[54] As with sulfonate‐related binding interactions and protein–glycan interactions in general, individual events of viral protein binding to sialic acids are relatively weak and strong interactions depend on multivalency.[55] Accordingly, a wide range of nanomaterial scaffolds with multiple sialic acid residues have been designed to competitively bind to influenza virus particles and thus prevent viral infection. Recent efforts have focused on how precisely tuning the distance between sialic acid residues on the scaffold affects HA binding. For example, Bandlow et al. investigated how rigid scaffolds composed of self‐assembled complexes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) enhanced binding interactions compared to more flexible, polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.[56] This finding agreed well with antiviral testing data on rigid and flexible core trivalent sialosides too.[57] Another important design variable has been considering linear versus branched scaffolds.[58] In one promising example, Kwon et al. reported the fabrication of a branched polyamidoamine scaffold that mirrored the inter‐spacing distance between HA proteins on influenza virus particles and intranasal administration of this scaffold was able to protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection.[59] Other recent examples include more sophisticated nanomaterial designs involving three‐way nucleic acid junctions[60] and star glycopolymers.[61] In addition to polymer‐like scaffolds, there has been ongoing exploration of sialic‐functionalized nanoparticles and a key example involves bacteriophage capsid nanoparticles with well‐controlled spacing of sialic acid‐functionalized ligands (Figure 4a,b).[62] Capsid nanoparticles with the correct Sia1 sialic acid ligands could specifically bind to influenza virus particles while nanoparticles functionalized with other glycan ligands did not bind to virus particles (Figure 4c,d). Likewise, only Sia1‐functionalized nanoparticles could inhibit influenza virus infection of MDCK‐II and human lung‐derived A549 cells in vitro in a dose‐dependent fashion and influenza virus pretreatment with the nanoparticles also protected mice from infection‐related weight loss in vivo (Figure 4e,f).

Richard et al. have also systematically investigated how sialic acid‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can be designed in terms of core nanoparticle size and linker length and unraveled how these parameters influence multivalent binding interactions, which can give rise to highly specific binding to particular ligand geometries.[63] In terms of soft‐matter nanoparticles, Bhatia et al. have also investigated the design of ≈250 nm diameter sialylated nanogel particles with varying degrees of flexibility and observed that highly flexible nanogel particles inhibited cell attachment of influenza virus by up to 400 times, as compared to more rigid nanogel particles.[64] The flexible nanogel particles also prevented influenza infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro down to picomolar concentrations. In another interesting example, Kong et al. reported the development of sialic acid‐functionalized lipid nanodisks that can bind to and cause perforation of influenza virus particles.[65] This example demonstrated that sialic acid‐functionalized nanoparticles can exhibit additional mechanistic functions beyond inhibiting virus‐cell interactions only and intravenous administration of the nanodisks also protected mice against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. In addition to new nanoparticle designs, there has been extensive recent progress in developing nanoscience measurement tools to quantify influenza viral protein‐sialic acid binding interactions. For example, single‐molecule force spectroscopy experiments have been conducted to comparatively measure the binding strength of influenza HA and neuraminidase proteins to sialic acid receptors[66] and the effects of multivalency on such interactions.[67] Di Iorio et al. have also fabricated sialic acid‐functionalized lipid bilayers and measured the binding of ≈22 nm diameter clusters of recombinant influenza HA proteins to supported lipid bilayers by quartz crystal microbalance‐dissipation (QCM‐D) experiments.[68] Other techniques such as microcavity arrays can also measure the diffusional motion of HA proteins bound to sialic acid‐functionalized supported lipid bilayers.[69] To date, most of these measurement strategies have been employed for understanding the fundamental role of multivalency in viral protein–glycan interactions while there remains tremendous potential to utilize these approaches for evaluating the functional performance of new nanomaterial inhibitors as well as to test drug inhibitor candidates that prevent such interactions.[70] 4.2.3 Additional Strategies In addition to glycan‐based decoy binding strategies for competitive inhibition, nucleic acid nanostructures have enabled creative design possibilities based on self‐assembling, complex topologies. For example, Kwon et al. reported the design of 3D DNA nanostructures with highly precise architectural features and incorporated Dengue viral protein‐binding aptamers within the nanostructure, which could bind multivalently to Dengue virus particles.[71] Different nanostructures such as heptagons, hexagons, and stars were tested and it was discovered that the star nanostructure yielded the most potent inhibitory activity to prevent Dengue virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to inhibit Dengue virus was around 2 × 10−9 m for star nanostructures, as compared to 10 × 10−9 and 440 × 10−9 m for the hexagon and heptagon nanostructures, respectively. This example provides an important demonstration of how synthetic receptors can be engineered in the future to develop more potent nanomaterial options, especially from natural, biocompatible materials, and with self‐assembling properties. These synthetic capabilities have also inspired current efforts to develop nanomaterial inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 based on understanding what receptor the virus binds and how to design receptor‐mimicking decoys. Specifically, the latest scientific evidence supports that SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the membrane‐associated angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell surfaces as part of the infection process.[72] Han et al. have reported the computational design of peptides that correspond to structurally important regions of ACE2 and can bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins to prevent infection.[73] It was suggested that the inhibitory peptides could be attached to nanoparticles with multivalent presentation, while such design strategies would require a careful consideration of how to best optimize the peptide attachment in terms of attachment chemistry, flexibility, density, and peptide conformation. There is also interest in engineering the ACE2 protein to bind more strongly to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins[74] and experimental work to test antiviral peptide inhibitors in this direction is ongoing. 4.3 Cell Membrane Decoys Over the past decade, there has been extensive and rapidly growing interest in coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane extracts to confer advantageous biological properties. For example, Hu et al. demonstrated that coating polymeric nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes can increase circulation time in mice.[75] It has also been demonstrated that cloaking polymeric nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of human platelets can improve immunocompatibility in terms of lower macrophage uptake and reduced complement activation, along with additional platelet‐like functionalities.[76] Ongoing progress in the field has also sparked interest in developing cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles that contain virus‐binding receptors and hence can bind to virus particles in order to prevent infection.[77] Numerous viruses such as Dengue and Zika are transmitted by mosquito vectors[78] and Rao et al. demonstrated that gelatin nanoparticles coated with mosquito cell membrane extracts can bind to Zika virus particles, whereby each ≈130 nm diameter nanoparticle binds to multiple virus particles.[79] This approach led to dose‐dependent reduction in viral infectivity of Vero cells in vitro and intravenous administration of the coated nanoparticles up to 2 days postinoculation also protected mice against virus‐induced mortality and body weight loss and reduced the level of viral infection in the brain. Red blood cell membrane‐coated magnetic nanoparticles with sialylated functional groups have also been employed to capture influenza virus particles.[80] In addition to using natural cell membrane extracts that contain typical amounts of virus‐binding receptors, there have been attempts to engineer cells to overexpress those receptors and to prepare cell‐derived membrane vesicles accordingly. For example, Liu et al. devised a biosynthetic strategy to overexpress the membrane receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is called human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), in HepG2 cells and prepared ≈200 nm diameter, cell membrane‐derived vesicles that were used to inhibit HBV infection of HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro and in mice with humanized livers in vivo (Figure 5a).[81] Compared to control membrane vesicles from the parent cell line with normal receptor quantities, the membrane vesicles from the engineered cell line with an overexpressed quantity of receptors exhibited appreciably greater antiviral activity levels and demonstrated improved treatment efficacy in the mouse model, as indicated by lower levels of HBV antibodies and nucleic acid copies (Figure 5b,c). Recently, Rao et al. reported the fabrication of cell membrane‐derived vesicles from human monocyte cells that were genetically engineered to express the ACE2 receptor and the ACE2‐functionalized vesicles could prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro.[82] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint [ 81 ] Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH. d) Strategy to capture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus particles by using cell‐membrane‐coated polymeric nanoparticles termed nanosponges (NS).

Similar approaches have also been taken to treat and prevent infection by HIV, which is known to infect T cells.[83] Polymeric nanoparticles were coated with the plasma membranes of CD4+ T cells, which contain the receptors needed for virus binding and cell entry, and the cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human‐monocyte‐derived macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, it was suggested that this cell membrane decoy strategy could be potentially advantageous to work against multiple, genetically diverse HIV strains because all strains bind to the same cell receptors.[85] A follow‐up study confirmed that the T cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit a wide range of HIV‐1 strains and surprisingly induced autophagy of HIV‐infected cells to suppress viral genome replication but had no effect on uninfected cells.[86] Recently, cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles have also been developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro (Figure 5d).[84] Nanoparticles coated with extracts from human lung epithelial type II or macrophage cells inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent fashion while nanoparticles coated with extracts from red blood cells were inactive (Figure 5e). These findings emphasize the importance of rationally designing biomimetic nanomaterial strategies based on a precise understanding of how a certain virus affects cells, and further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of these inhibitory capabilities in vivo.

5 Viral Membrane Inhibitors Most nanomaterial‐based antiviral strategies focus on targeting viral protein components in order to prevent virus‐cell binding interactions as described in the preceding examples. However, various types of viruses use distinct binding receptors to enter cells and such strategies are therefore intrinsically limited to working against a relatively narrow subset of viruses. On the other hand, many viral epidemics are caused by membrane‐enveloped viruses and a structurally intact viral membrane on enveloped viruses is necessary for viral infectivity, including virus‐cell fusion.[87] As such, a wide range of broad‐spectrum antiviral drug candidates have been explored to inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses based on targeting the viral membrane.[87] One of the most exciting groups of drug candidates within this class are membrane‐disruptive, antiviral peptides that inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses in order to abrogate viral infectivity.[88] Several antiviral peptides have been discovered that inhibit a wide range of membrane‐enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)[89] and HIV,[90] and include a 27‐mer amphipathic, α‐helical (AH) peptide that exhibits membrane‐curvature‐selective disruptive activity to inhibit small, membrane‐enveloped virus particles of ≈160 nm diameter or smaller.[91] In vitro antiviral testing experiments against various types of membrane‐enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have been conducted using a wide range of permissive, model cell lines such as Vero cells and human liver‐derived Huh 7.5 cells as well as primary cells such as mouse neuronal cells and human T cells. The results have demonstrated that some membrane‐active peptides exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses down to the nanomolar range along with low cell cytotoxicity.[92] While viral envelopes are derived from host cell membranes, the AH peptide and possibly other peptides can exhibit selective rupture of highly curved viral membranes due to membrane‐curvature‐triggered membrane disruption.[93] Indeed, mammalian cells are much larger than virus particles and hence possess an appreciably lower degree of membrane curvature and this curvature difference provides a distinguishing factor between viral and mammalian cell membranes.[94] These promising mechanistic features have motivated researchers to explore how to utilize viral‐membrane‐targeting, antiviral peptides in vivo, while exploring design strategies to overcome traditional challenges of peptide therapeutics, such as high susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and short circulation time.[95] To overcome these challenges, Jackman et al. explored the development of an engineered version of the AH peptide, composed of all D‐amino acids and termed AH‐D, which was able to therapeutically treat lethal Zika virus infection in a mouse model in vivo.[92] The basic design concept was called lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD) and posited that extracellular targeting of membrane‐enveloped viruses can reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in order to help curb viral infection (Figure 6a). Upon intravenous administration of the AH‐D peptide starting 3 days post‐virus inoculation, over 80% of mice survived Zika virus infection and exhibited markedly reduced clinical symptoms in general. Importantly, the AH‐D peptide was able to significantly reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in the blood as well as in multiple organs, including in the brain (Figure 6b). More extensive studies revealed that the AH‐D peptide is able to cross the intact blood‐brain barrier to treat Zika virus infection directly in the brain as well as to reduce infection‐related brain inflammation (Figure 6c,d).

From a material science perspective, another noteworthy point is that a large portion of the mechanistic understanding about how AH and AH‐D peptides work has been obtained from biosensing measurement strategies involving biomimetic, virus‐particle‐mimicking vesicles in combination with acoustic‐, optical‐, nanoplasmonic‐, and fluorescence‐microscopy‐based techniques.[91, 96] Examples include nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and plasmonic nanohole sensors[97] (Figure 6e–i). Such insights have led to further exploration of the AH‐D peptide as an antiviral drug candidate to prevent Zika virus infection of fetuses in pregnant mice[98] and forward‐looking discussion about how the LEAD concept could be useful for broadly treating mosquito‐borne virus infections, including not only Zika but also Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever among various possibilities.[99] This capability could be especially beneficial when a mosquito‐borne viral infection is clinically suspected but a differential diagnosis of the specific virus type is challenging.[100] The LEAD concept might be generally applicable to other types of membrane‐enveloped viruses as well since the viral membrane represents an Achilles heel and there is a high barrier to the emergence of drug‐resistant strains because the viral membrane is derived from host cell membranes and not encoded within the viral genome.[101] It has even been suggested that membrane‐enveloped SARS‐CoV‐2 might be susceptible to viral membrane disruption[102] and these aspects are particularly important because SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the brain has been linked to a wide range of COVID‐19 disease conditions.[103] While intravenously administered, antiviral peptides have demonstrated initial promise in some mouse models of viral infections, nanomaterial‐based drug delivery strategies could improve pharmacological activities and lead to improved targeting possibilities. Zhang et al. have reported the development of a cationic, membrane‐active antiviral peptide that was mixed together with anionic polymer chains to form ≈35 nm diameter nanoparticles.[104] These peptide‐polymer nanoparticles exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against HCV infection of Huh 7.5 cells and HIV infection of TZM‐bl cells, human lymphocytes, and monocyte‐derived macrophages, respectively, and also showed lower levels of hemolytic activity against red blood cells than the free peptide alone. Intramuscular injection of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles showed improved treatment of HIV‐1 infection in a mouse model in vivo, as compared to free peptide alone. In a follow‐up study, a refined version of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles was developed that was functionalized with galactosyl sugar molecules in order to enable improved HepG2 cell internalization in vitro and preferential liver accumulation in mice in vivo.[105] Ongoing work can further expand the potential of targeting membrane‐enveloped viruses by using antiviral peptides and other classes of small‐molecule inhibitors[106] that impair viral membrane‐associated proteins to prevent virus‐cell fusion in combination with nanomaterial strategies to enhance targeted delivery prospects. In addition to directly targeting virus particles, it might be possible to also disrupt membrane‐enveloped exosomes that carry viral components such as nucleic acids and proteins and can be involved in viral infection and transmission processes.[107]

6 Virus‐Removing Blood Filters Another approach to effectively remove circulating virus particles from the blood of infected hosts has relied on the use of extracorporeal blood‐filtering devices and advances upon medical device technology that was originally used to treat sepsis infections.[108] Early work by Kang et al. demonstrated that a microfluidic device can effectively remove a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood.[109] To achieve this objective, ≈130 nm diameter magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) protein molecules, which can bind to sugar molecules found on the surface of various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses along with endotoxins.[110] The MBL‐functionalized nanoparticles were mixed together with circulating blood, could bind to circulating pathogens, and then the nanoparticle‐pathogen mixtures could be magnetically separated before the blood was returned to the host. In rat models of bacterial infection, more than 90% of bacteria were reduced along with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Seiler et al. have further explored the use of an engineered version of MBL that demonstrated improved pathogen capture in blood and urine samples.[111] Based on these findings, there has been ongoing progress to develop extracorporeal blood filters for virus particle removal applications as well. Tullis et al. demonstrated that hemodialysis treatment using a hollow‐fiber cartridge that contained antibody‐functionalized agarose beads could effectively remove HIV‐1 virus particles and viral proteins from cell culture media and blood.[112] These capabilities have led to the exploration of clinical‐stage medical device technology to broadly capture a wide range of circulating virus particles by replacing the antibody functionalization with MBL functionalization. Early reports indicated preliminary testing success to capture HIV and HCV virus particles along with binding to Dengue, influenza, Ebola, and Marburg viral proteins.[113] A pilot human clinical trial using a full‐scale version of this medical device technology was used to remove HCV from the blood of 4 HCV‐positive patients and resulted in an average drop in HCV viral loads of around 57%.[114] Follow‐up studies showed HCV viral load reductions in additional patients and it was further suggested that continuous application of this treatment approach could potentially reduce HCV to clinically undetectable levels within a few days, especially if used in combination with conventional antiviral drug therapies.[115] Büttner et al. have also reported that the medical device technology has been used to treat one patient with Ebola virus infection[116] and recent works have explored how these extracorporeal blood filters might be useful to remove coronaviruses and Marburg virus from infected blood.[117] With respect to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it has also been noted that virus‐removing blood filters could be a useful technology.[118] Given the small number of patients in the aforementioned clinical testing, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present stage, however, there are bright prospects to continue exploring virus‐removing blood filter technology. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the initiation of a feasibility study, with up to 40 human patients, to test the treatment efficacy of an extracorporeal blood filter based on this medical device technology for patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis and severe COVID‐19 disease.[119] In terms of future innovation in this direction, it is important to continue exploring how to develop improved filtration devices while also creating new biofunctionalization strategies to improve virus‐binding capacity and perhaps apply peptide functionalization schemes to catalytically damage virus particles as opposed to intact virus particle binding alone. Looking forward, these medical device technologies can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antiviral drug therapies to lower the amount of infectious virus particles in blood while also inhibiting the production of new virus particles among other possibilities.

7 Virus‐Mimicking Nanoparticle Vaccines 7.1 Design Rationale There has also been tremendous progress in developing nanoparticle‐based vaccine strategies to prevent and treat viral infections. In general, viral infections provoke the immune system, which can recognize viral proteins on the virus particle surface (“antigens”) and produce antibodies that bind to these antigens to neutralize virus particles.[120] In some cases, natural antibodies produced in response to a viral infection can have extremely high specificity and potency to inhibit virus particles.[121] For these reasons, the blood plasma from patients who recover from a certain type of virus infection is often given as a medical treatment to infected patients afflicted with the same type of virus infection.[122] In such cases, the plasma can contain high levels of neutralizing antibodies that bind to and inhibit virus particles.[123] However, the specific types and concentrations of antibodies present in blood plasma vary from person‐to‐person, potentially limiting reliable clinical use.[124] Hence, there has been extensive interest in recombinantly manufacturing specific, highly potent neutralizing antibodies as an alternative treatment option.[125] This latter approach allows more precise control over antibody composition and dosing. Recombinant antibody therapies also reduce the risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, which can arise in some cases from non‐neutralizing antibodies that are also present in plasma.[125, 126] The same logic applies to vaccine development where the key objective is to administer a virus‐mimicking immunogenic material so that a strong and focused immune response can be trained. The target objective is to generate high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies while minimizing production of non‐neutralizing antibodies that can otherwise inadvertently promote virus infection in some cases. Over the past few years, virus‐mimicking nanomaterial design strategies have been at the forefront of creating next‐generation vaccine strategies now reaching human clinical trials. The combination of nanomaterials, biomimetics, and protein engineering has led to unprecedented capabilities to rationally finetune immune responses and elicit high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies in a safe and effective manner. These capabilities are currently being extended to develop a nanoparticle vaccine candidate to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Recent progress in the field highlights the merits of both natural and engineered protein scaffolds to create self‐assembling, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines with excellent biomechanical and immunological properties. The fast‐moving progress on this subject is reviewed in this section along with coverage of other vaccine nanoparticle strategies. 7.2 Types of Nanoparticle Vaccines There is broad interest in integrating material science and protein engineering strategies to develop safe, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines that present viral protein antigens in a highly organized and symmetrical manner in order to induce strong immune responses.[127] Compared to free antigens, nanoparticle vaccines have several compelling advantages, including greater antigen stability, multivalent presentation of antigens, and targeted delivery.[128] As such, nanoparticle vaccines can bind multivalently to multiple receptors on B cells, which are immune cells involved in antibody production, resulting in more robust immune responses and high levels of immune protection.[24] A wide variety of nanoparticle types are being explored to prevent infectious diseases in general, including self‐assembling protein nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomal nanoparticles, and polymer scaffolds.[129] Key design considerations include optimizing the antigen structure (more precisely, the immunogen structure) to elicit the desired immune response, tuning vaccine delivery, and inducing focused immune responses.[130] From a biomimetic perspective, one of the most promising recent design advances has involved self‐assembled nanoparticle vaccines as discussed below along with introducing other nanoparticle vaccine design strategies. 7.2.1 Natural Protein Scaffolds The earliest example of a natural protein scaffold to form a nanoparticle vaccine involved the use of ferritin, which self‐assembles into nearly spherical, hollow nanoparticles that have ≈12 nm core diameter and are composed of 24 protein molecules with symmetrical organization.[131] By overcoming several challenges related to protein glycosylation and oligomerization, Kanekiyo et al. first reported the design of a ferritin‐based, influenza nanoparticle vaccine in 2013 that presented eight trimers of influenza HA viral protein on the nanoparticle surface in a native‐like configuration that enabled a superior immune response to conventionally used influenza vaccine strategies based on inactivated virus particles.[132] From a material science perspective, the key innovation was controlling the location at which ferritin and HA were genetically fused together in order to recombinantly express ferritin‐HA fusion proteins that self‐assembled into nanoparticles with repetitively spaced, trimeric HA spikes (Figure 7a,b). Ferritin‐HA nanoparticle immunization induced a strong immune response, as indicated by high levels of neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza H1N1 strains and protection against influenza virus infection in a ferret model (Figure 7c,d). Recently, Kelly et al. have elucidated how ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccination in mice triggers principally germinal center expansion and maturation of memory B cells, which are involved in antibody production.[133] In another study, Yassine et al. further explored the development of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines that presented a truncated version of HA, which corresponded to the stem region that is conserved across different HA subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and hence its trimeric presentation on the nanoparticle surface conferred protection against a wider range of influenza subtypes in mouse and ferret models.[134] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ).

Ferritin nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed to prevent infections from viruses such as HIV‐1 and Sliepen et al. first reported the design of ferritin nanoparticles presenting HIV‐1 envelope (Env) protein trimers, which demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity in mice and rabbits.[136] Neutralizing antibodies were generated to inhibit some but not all HIV‐1 strains, and it was particularly challenging to inhibit certain strains classified as “difficult‐to‐neutralize”.[137] It was discussed how the nanoparticle design might be improved by reducing steric hindrance between adjacent Env trimers. He et al. refined the structure‐based design of the trimeric Env antigens presented on the ferritin nanoparticle surface along with optimizing spacing between the trimers in order to yield more robust B cell responses.[138] More detailed engineering of the Env antigen structure increased Env trimer recognition on the ferritin nanoparticles by a broader range of naïve B cells, resulting in elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.[139] Due to the high sequence variation among Env proteins across different HIV‐1 strains, Sliepen et al. have designed a new Env antigen structure based on a consequence sequence incorporating the epitopes of many broadly neutralizing antibodies, and presented the Env antigen trimers on ferritin nanoparticles to yield strong neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits and macaques.[140] In addition, He et al. have reported additional protein engineering efforts to improve the stability of wild‐type Env antigens by switching out the ectodomain with a more stable version from an engineered Env antigen, which enabled improved generation of neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit difficult‐to‐neutralize HIV‐1 strains, in mice and rabbits.[141] Together, the ongoing work with ferritin‐Env nanoparticle vaccines to prevent HIV‐1 infection demonstrates the superior immune responses generated by antigen trimers on the nanoparticle surface, while highlighting the potential to combine these nanomaterial efforts with antigen‐based protein engineering efforts. Such possibilities have also been explored for a wide range of other viruses and support the broad versatility of ferritin nanoparticle technology for developing next‐generation vaccines. Kanekiyo et al. have designed a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) infection by conjugating ferritin molecules to a truncated domain from the EBV gp350 protein that contains the receptor‐binding site needed for B cell infection.[142] On the ferritin nanoparticle surface, the antigen formed dimers, which is a distinct conformation to the trimeric presentation cases discussed above. Importantly, compared to the soluble gp350 antigen, the nanoparticle vaccine still elicited markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies by 10‐ to 100‐fold in mice and nonhuman primates and also conferred protective immunity on mice in a lethal virus challenge model. Bu et al. have also developed another form of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent EBV infection based on a different antigen (gH), which alone and in complexation with gL and gp42 proteins helps to generate neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus‐cell fusion and works against multiple cell types instead of only preventing B cell infection.[143] In another important example, Wang et al. have reported a dual‐targeting, ferritin nanoparticle vaccine strategy to prevent and treat chronic HBV infection in mice based on activating two types of immune cells to induce high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibodies.[144] Recent work has further demonstrated that ferritin nanoparticles are an excellent platform to present viral antigens for developing HCV vaccines that might work against a wide range of HCV genotypes[145] and also to develop vaccines for treating RSV infection.[146] Notably, in the latter case, a glycosylated version of the RSV antigen was designed that induced a higher ratio of neutralizing antibodies to non‐neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates, which could be significant because higher levels of non‐neutralizing antibodies are thought to be associated with antibody‐mediated disease enhancement.[146] In addition to fabricating ferritin nanoparticles composed of one type of building block component, there has been interest in developing two‐component ferritin nanoparticles in order to present oligomers of multiple antigens on the nanoparticle surface. For example, Georgiev et al. reported the development of ferritin nanoparticles composed of two types of ferritin constructs, one of which was fused to an influenza virus antigen and the other one of which was fused to an HIV‐1 antigen, and nanoparticle self‐assembly resulted in trimeric presentation of both antigens.[147] Importantly, vaccination with this nanoparticle strategy in guinea pigs could induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibited both viruses. Since there are many different subtypes of influenza virus, Kanekiyo et al. expanded on this nanoparticle design strategy to design and coassemble ferritin‐HA constructs encoding HA with one of two receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) and the resulting nanoparticles had mosaic HA trimers that presented a mixture of RBDs to yield a broader antibody response than nanoparticles with either RBD alone.[148] Vaccination in mice led to the discovery of a neutralizing antibody that works against a wide range of influenza virus strains. Accordingly, nanoparticle‐based strategies presenting multiple antigens have been suggested as one possible route to create a universal influenza vaccine.[25] While ferritin nanoparticles have proven useful for creating vaccine nanoparticle technology, there has been extensive interest in identifying other natural protein scaffolds that can self‐assemble into nanoparticles with different sizes. Also in 2013, Jardine et al. reported the development of ≈32 nm diameter, self‐assembling nanoparticles composed of 60 recombinantly expressed lumazine synthase (LS) protein molecules from Aquifex aeolicus, which exhibit symmetrical organization, and designed an LS fusion protein together with HIV‐1 Env antigen that could form nanoparticles with enhanced B cell activation and lymph node trafficking properties.[149] In follow‐up work, an improved version of the LS nanoparticle vaccine platform was designed and induced promising immune responses in different mouse models in vivo, toward the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV‐1 infection.[150] Havenar‐Daughton et al. further investigated single‐dose immunization of rhesus monkeys with this HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccine and noted that subcutaneous immunization yielded markedly larger B cell responses and lymph node drainage than intramuscular drainage.[151] Tokatlian et al. have also explored how antigen glycosylation of LS‐ and ferritin‐based HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines is an important factor in modulating antibody responses (Figure 7e,f).[135] The results demonstrated that antigen glycosylation is an important factor in eliciting high levels of antigen‐specific antibody levels and appreciably lower levels were observed with deglycosylated antigen (Figure 7g). Additionally, Krebs et al. have investigated ≈23 nm diameter nanoparticle self‐assembly from the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in order to create nanoparticle vaccines presenting an HIV‐1 Env antigen fragment, which yielded an antigen‐specific antibody in immunized rabbits although multiple rounds of immunization were needed to elicit moderately protective, neutralizing antibody levels in a large fraction of rabbits.[152] As seen in these examples, it is important to point out that self‐assembled nanoparticles from different natural protein scaffolds have distinct functionalities, as noted by how protein scaffolds fused together with full‐length viral protein antigens can only self‐assemble into nanoparticles for some, but not all, of the scaffold options and antigen spacing is another important factor affecting both nanoparticle self‐assembly and immunogenicity.[138] In part, such design issues have motivated the use of full‐length viral proteins or truncated versions thereof and the type of nanoparticle structure can also affect antigen oligomerization in some cases.[142] Another important point concerns the nanoparticle vaccine fabrication strategy. To date, the structural components of virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines have been recombinantly expressed in host cells in vitro and, upon expression, spontaneously self‐assemble into antigen‐presenting nanoparticles. In such cases, the nanoparticle vaccine suspension is then injected into animals as part of the immunization process. As an alternative strategy, recent work has also investigated nucleic‐acid‐based vaccination strategies that could enable the in vivo expression of nanoparticle structural components and, in some cases, in vivo self‐assembly of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. Melo et al. reported the development of a lipid‐nanoparticle‐encapsulated alphavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) replicon encoding the HIV Env antigen fused with LS.[153] A single injection of this lipid nanoparticle suspension encoding the HIV Env antigen yielded high levels of Env‐specific antibodies and also led to improved B cell responses compared to recombinant protein immunization. In another demonstration, Xu et al. reported the use of a DNA vaccine plasmid to induce the in vivo expression of a nanoparticle structural component comprising an HIV Env antigen fused with LS, and demonstrated its in vivo structural assembly in mice based on functional studies along with improved immune responses in mice and guinea pigs compared to immunization with a similar delivery strategy encoding antigen monomers only.[154] The design concept was further generalized to other natural protein scaffolds, such as ferritin nanoparticles, which also induced high immune responses and the delivery strategy could also be adapted to influenza HA antigen in order to endow mice with protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge. From a translational perspective, there has been tremendous progress in developing ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccines for preventing influenza infections based on ongoing human clinical trials being conducted in the United States. Preliminary data from the first‐in‐human trial (NCT03186781) of a ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccine provided initial evidence that the vaccine is safe and well‐tolerated in humans while another human clinical trial (NCT03814720) is ongoing to evaluate the dosing, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ferritin‐HA‐stem nanoparticles as a potential universal flu vaccine candidate. 7.2.2 Engineered Protein Scaffolds The insights gained from nanoparticle vaccines based on self‐assembling natural protein scaffolds have highlighted the importance of tuning antigen structure, conformation, density, and spacing on the nanoparticle surface. While several types of self‐assembling proteins exist in nature, the number of options is intrinsically limited, which has prompted researchers to further explore the design of nanoparticle vaccines from self‐assembling, engineered protein scaffolds that enable greater control over nanomaterial properties. Toward this goal, King et al. reported computational strategies to design 24‐subunit protein nanomaterials composed of two types of self‐assembling protein subunit components, and experimentally demonstrated that it was possible to rationally tune the nanomaterial structure, shape, and symmetry in alignment with the computational designs.[155] In another study, Bale et al. applied similar approaches to design larger, two‐component protein nanomaterials composed of 120 subunits with icosahedral symmetry and had 24–40 nm diameters that are similar to the size of small viral capsids.[156] Another advantage of using two‐component engineered proteins is greater control over the fabrication process. Natural protein scaffolds self‐assemble upon recombinant expression while engineered protein components can be expressed independently and then mixed as desired to self‐assemble into nanoparticles in vitro. Marcandalli et al. reported the first example of an engineered‐protein‐based nanoparticle vaccine that was built from two self‐assembling components and presented multiple copies of a trimeric RSV envelope antigen termed DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8a,b).[157] One protein component was designed to present DS‐Cav1 and spontaneously formed trimers by itself, while the other protein component formed pentamers by itself. The two protein components were expressed independently and, when mixed together in vitro, 20 trimers of the first protein component and 12 pentamers of the second protein component self‐assembled to form two‐component nanoparticles with ≈55 nm diameter inclusive of the antigen trimer spikes. Unlike previous nanoparticle vaccine designs, it was possible to control the density of DS‐Cav1 antigen trimer on the nanoparticle surface based on mixing different amounts of the first protein component with a genetically fused version of the first protein component that presents DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8c). Importantly, the nanoparticle presentation of DS‐Cav1 trimers not only improved antigen physical stability but also nanoparticle vaccine immunization in mice and nonhuman primates led to nearly 10‐fold higher neutralizing antibody titers along with a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response than immunization with soluble DS‐Cav1 trimers (Figure 8d). Brouwer et al. have also used a similar two‐component nanoparticle strategy to present HIV‐1 envelope antigen trimers.[158] In this case, the two‐component nanoparticle induced particularly high antibody responses after a single round of immunization, as compared to the same antigen trimers in soluble form and displayed on single‐component ferritin nanoparticles. There is ongoing exploration of different nanoparticle shape designs[159] and how nanoparticle formulations can improve lymph node targeting in nonhuman primate models.[160] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ) and the bar indicates the geometric mean, which is listed for each test group.

In terms of COVID‐19 vaccine development, Walls et al. recently reported the development of a two‐component nanoparticle vaccine candidate that displays the RBD of a SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope protein antigen (Figure 8e).[161] From a nanomaterial design perspective, a key innovation was introducing a genetically encoded flexible linker to connect the smaller RBD domain with the main nanoparticle structure. It is also noteworthy that the basic self‐assembling nanoparticle design involved the same two protein components as in the RSV and HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines described above, demonstrating the modular nature of nanoparticle vaccines and the ability to rationally swap antigens to support rapid vaccine development (Figure 8f). Importantly, the COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine induced nearly ten‐fold greater neutralizing antibody titers in mice than a soluble antigen trimer even when the nanoparticles were administered at a five‐time lower dose (Figure 8g). The nanoparticle vaccine also induced a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response, as compared to human convalescent sera. This immune response resulted in complete protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an in vivo virus challenge mouse model (Figure 8h). The combination of these features has further spurred ongoing manufacturing efforts to create a COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine in abundant quantities for potential human clinical trials. Looking forward, Ueda et al. have also continued designing new nanoparticle vaccine designs that are tailored for different types of viral protein domains[157] and there is excellent potential to continue exploring protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. As control over the molecular‐level biomimetic features of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines continues to improve, there will be growing emphasis on production scalability and how these nanoparticle vaccines can compete with other vaccine candidates in terms of practical factors such as cost, storage, and scalability. 7.2.3 Additional Scaffold Options While there has been tremendous progress in developing protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines to prevent viral infections, liposome‐ and inorganic nanoparticle‐based strategies have also proven advantageous and demonstrate important nanomaterial desiBiomimetic Nanomaterial Strategies for Virus Targeting: Antiviral Therapies and VaccinesBiomimetic nanomaterials have excellent potential to combat viral infections and lay the groundwork for next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

Since virus particles are nanoscale entities, nanomaterial design strategies are ideally suited to create advanced materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles. In this progress report, the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials are critically discussed for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Particular focus is placed on nanomaterial design concepts and material innovations that can be readily developed to thwart future viral threats. Pertinent nanomaterial examples from the COVID‐19 situation are also covered along with discussion of human clinical trial efforts underway that might lead to next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there have been growing calls to recognize that emerging infectious diseases represent a major threat to global health and that we must be better prepared to deal with a future viral pandemic, which could arise from an unknown or understudied virus.[1] In 2018, the World Health Organization expanded on these viewpoints by preparing a list of viral and nonviral pathogens that could cause Disease X, a future human disease outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential that would be triggered by a newly emerged pathogen.[2] In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic arose as the first Disease X and was caused by the global spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has infected over 39 million people and caused over 1 100 000 deaths to date.[3] COVID‐19 is considered by some experts to be a once‐in‐a‐century pandemic[4] and has highlighted how viral pandemics can create a perfect storm of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that is disrupting the institutions of daily life worldwide, including work, healthcare, education, and transportation.[5] Our understanding of COVID‐19 continues to grow since a local outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and led to the discovery of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is related to other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[6] SARS‐CoV‐2 is believed to be a zoonotic virus that crossed over from bats[7] and acquired mutations via natural selection that caused the virus to more efficiently infect human cells and transmit among humans.[8] Early reports of human respiratory disease[9] have since been followed up by numerous, ongoing studies to gain further insight into COVID‐19 disease pathogenesis, including how severe cases of COVID‐19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.[10] Various organs are affected by the disease, including lungs,[11] heart,[12] liver,[13] kidney,[14] and brain.[15] As such, there has been tremendous attention placed on the treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and growing attention to the role that materials science can play in stopping COVID‐19 and, more broadly, the wide range of viral infections affecting global society along with future viral threats.[16] The objective of this progress report is to cover the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Major emphasis is placed on covering the most recent developments mainly within the past three years, while distilling key nanomaterial design principles that can lead to next‐generation advanced materials for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Where applicable, we also discuss how these nanomaterial strategies are being explored to stop SARS‐CoV‐2 along with coverage of relevant human clinical trial efforts.

2 Advanced Materials for Virus Targeting Virus particles (“virions”) are biological nanoparticles that contain viral genetic material and are surrounded by a protein or lipid bilayer membrane coating. The particles are typically around 50–300 nm in diameter and are functionalized with glycoproteins that play an important role in binding to cells.[17] There are two main types: enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Membrane‐enveloped viruses are surrounded by a host‐cell‐derived lipid membrane that contains embedded glycoproteins while nonenveloped viruses have a protein‐based capsid shell without lipid membrane.[18] In both cases, the glycoproteins on the virus particle surface are the major antigens, which are recognized by the host immune system and can elicit an antibody response.[19] Once the immune system is trained to recognize a viral antigen, the immune system can rapidly produce antibodies that bind to the virus particles and prevent them from causing infection.[20] Fundamentally, virus particles are parasites that must infect susceptible cells and highjack cellular machinery in order to produce new virus particles.[21] The basic steps are presented in Scheme 1a. The first step involves virus particle binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface, which can result in cellular entry and start of the infection process. Each type of cell has a characteristic pattern of receptors found on the cellular surface and different viruses bind preferentially to particular ones. For example, many viruses bind specifically to glycan‐functionalized receptors containing sulfonate or sialyl functional groups. Infected cells produce new copies of viral genetic material and viral proteins, which are then assembled in order to produce new virus particles that are released extracellularly and infect new cells. The process continues indefinitely until an organism succumbs to virus‐induced cellular damage and related immune responses, and viruses can also spread between organisms via a wide range of transmission mechanisms. Scheme 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Biomimetic nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. a) Overview of virus life cycle. Viruses cannot replicate independently and must infect cells. The replication machinery of infected cells is highjacked by viruses and used to create new copies of the viral genome and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles that are released from the cell and spread to infect other cells. b) Examples of different nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. i) Nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors can inhibit the production of new virus particles. ii) Virus‐binding nanoparticles and iii) cell membrane decoys can bind to virus particles and prevent viral infection of cells. iv) Viral membrane inhibitors can disrupt membrane‐enveloped virus particles, abrogating infectivity. v) Extracorporeal blood filters can remove circulating virus particles from the bloodstream to reduce disease burden. vi) Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines that mimic the multivalent presentation of antigens on virus particle surfaces can elicit improved immune responses that lead to greater protection against future virus exposure. Depending on the objective, various nanomaterial strategies can be useful to stop viruses, as presented in Scheme 1b. Conventionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to inhibit viral genome replication inside infected cells, thereby preventing the production of new virus particles.[22] Nanomaterial strategies have proven useful to enhance the pharmacological properties of viral genome replication inhibitors, including circulation time. While it is advantageous to stop viral genome replication in order to help treat existing viral infections, there is also extensive interest in exploring how nanomaterials can be useful to prevent viral infections.[23] Virus‐binding nanomaterials can attach to virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells. Pristine nanomaterials can be used along with receptor‐functionalized ones and cell‐membrane‐decoy nanomaterials, which are coated with cell membrane extracts containing natural receptors. Ongoing efforts have also devised nanomaterial‐based strategies to effectively remove extracellular virus particles from infected organisms by either selectively disrupting virus particles or by removing them through extracorporeal filtration strategies. Moreover, some of the most recent and innovative advances have come from developing nanoparticle vaccines, especially self‐assembling protein‐based ones, which have demonstrated excellent potential to prevent multiple types of viral infections.[24] One of the most promising candidates has been rapidly advanced into human clinical trials as a potential universal flu vaccine[25] and similar strategies are now being applied to SARS‐CoV‐2. A key innovative aspect of these nanoparticle vaccines is that critical architectural properties of virus particles, particularly the specific organization of glycoprotein antigens, can now be mimicked with nanoscale precision and these advanced material capabilities have led to nanoparticle vaccine candidates with superior immunizing capabilities to currently used vaccine strategies in some cases. The latest progress in all of these areas is covered in the following sections.

3 Viral Replication Inhibitors The most widely used class of direct‐acting antiviral drugs encompasses small molecules that inhibit the genome replication of viruses inside infected cells.[26] These replication processes involve a multiprotein replication complex called the viral replicase[27] and antiviral therapy often targets one or more types of the viral proteins that form this complex. Key examples of antiviral drugs in this class include nucleoside and nucleotide analogues that inhibit the viral polymerase, which is the main enzyme involved in viral genome production.[28] Over the years, there have been extensive efforts to develop prodrugs[29]—inactive molecules that are metabolized into the active drug in vivo—and drug delivery systems that enable longer circulation time, targeted delivery, and/or improved safety of viral replication inhibitors, in line with broader innovation trends in the nanomedicine field as a whole. Promising examples include development of a once weekly, orally administered antiviral drug delivery platform that consists of several polymer matrices with different drug release profiles in order to consistently maintain pharmaceutically relevant concentrations of antiviral drugs in systemic circulation.[30] One of the most recent examples of cutting‐edge nanomaterial strategies to deliver viral replication inhibitors involves the class of macromolecular prodrugs, comprising polymer‐functionalized antiviral drugs in complexation with serum proteins. Andersen et al. described the formation of polymer–protein–drug complexes that enable long‐duration therapy with multiple antiviral drugs.[31] A polymer–protein complex comprised of a single, ≈7 kDa N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (PHPMA) chain per covalently attached albumin molecule was designed and exhibited much longer circulation half‐time and higher concentrations in mice upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as compared to free PHPMA alone. Marked accumulation of the polymer–protein complex in mouse lymph nodes was also reported. Two antiviral drugs, azidothymidine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), were covalently incorporated into the monomer backbone via a labile disulfide linkage for eventual intracellular release of free drug molecules. These functionalized building blocks were assembled into a colloidal‐like polymer–protein–drug complex consisting of one polymer chain with six AZT and four 3TC copies along with one albumin molecule and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human T cells in vitro. Frich et al. expanded on this macromolecular prodrug strategy by devising a “hitchhiking” scheme in which a polymer–drug conjugate was fabricated and exhibited noncovalent binding to serum albumin proteins, as indicated by biophysical experiments and increased circulation half‐time in mice in vivo.[32] The key innovation was functionalizing the PHPMA component with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) lipid, which is a binding ligand for serum albumin proteins found in circulation (Figure 1a). A polymer–drug conjugate was synthesized consisting of DSPE–PHPMA and multiple copies of acyclovir (ACV), which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpes simplex virus (HSV). It was verified that free ACV could be released from the DSPE–PHPMA–ACV complex upon incubation in physiologically relevant conditions containing glutathione (GSH). It was determined that >100 × 10−9 m ACV was released within 3 h from 1 g L–1 PHPMA–ACV in GSH‐containing phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) while nearly negligible release was observed over an appreciably longer time period of 24 h in PBS without GSH. Importantly, DSPE–PHPMA–ACV also exhibited antiviral activity against HSV type 2 (HSV‐2) infection of baby hamster kidney‐derived ELVIS and human cervix‐derived HeLa cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous administration of the polymer–drug complex helped to suppress vaginal HSV‐2 infection in an in vivo mouse model based on viral infectivity measurements of vaginal wash and spinal cord specimens (Figure 1b).

DSPE‐PHPMA was found to bind noncovalently to serum albumin proteins, which was associated with a longer circulation half‐time in mice. By contrast, PHPMA alone did not bind appreciably to albumins. b) Effect of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered DSPE‐PHPMA‐ACV, PHPMA‐ACV, free ACV, and no treatment (N.t.) on vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2) infection in an in vivo mouse model.

In addition to forming polymer–drug complexes, recent efforts have focused on creating macromolecular prodrugs from chemical derivatives of nucleoside analogues that can form nucleic acid scaffolds. For example, Krüger et al. demonstrated that idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to treat HSV infection, could be converted into a phosphoramidite derivative and then these building blocks were used to synthesize linear nucleic acid scaffolds with 7 or 14 attached drug molecules (Figure 1c).[33] In vitro release experiments revealed that the scaffolds are stable in serum‐free cell culture medium while free idoxuridine was gradually released within 2–6 h in the presence of serum, indicating the potential utility of these scaffolds for in vivo applications (Figure 1d). Future work needs to continue exploring the prophylactic and therapeutic utility of macromolecular prodrugs of viral replication inhibitors in animal models, while there exist numerous potential advantages in terms of well‐defined colloidal properties and targeted codelivery of two or more antiviral drugs to increase the barrier for drug‐resistant virus strains to emerge.[34] There also remains an outstanding need to investigate the mechanisms of drug release in vivo and to also continue exploring how macromolecular prodrugs can be engineered to target specific organs.

4 Virus Particle Binding Inhibitors 4.1 Pristine Nanomaterials Over the years, various classes of nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based nanomaterials have been synthesized and there are well‐developed methods to control atomic composition, size, and functional groups. Accordingly, systematic studies have long been conducted to test how different types of pristine nanomaterials—as‐synthesized nanomaterials without additional surface functionalization—affect virus particles and have revealed a variety of antiviral mechanisms related to virus particle binding and steric blocking, chemical reactions involving nanomaterial‐induced reactive species, and virus particle disruption, as extensively covered in numerous reviews.[35] To date, however, most of these antiviral activities have been characterized in vitro, while it is more challenging to use pristine nanomaterials in vivo where they can show diminished antiviral activity. Key challenges include nonspecific binding of nanomaterials to other biological components and the protein corona that can form spontaneously on nanomaterial surfaces upon immersion in physiological environments.[36] In addition to conventional nanomaterial options, there has also been extensive interest in designing nanomaterials from poorly soluble antimicrobial compounds, which can improve solubility and potential usability in some cases. For example, Huang et al. reported the fabrication of water‐dispersible, benzoxazine monomer‐derived carbon dots with ≈4 nm diameter, which inhibited a wide range of viruses, including Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and Dengue (Figure 2a).[37] Significant reductions in viral infectivity in vitro against baby hamster kidney‐derived BHK‐21 and monkey kidney‐derived Vero cells were observed upon pretreatment of virus particles with the carbon dots (Figure 2b,c). Another study involved the fabrication of water‐dispersible, glycyrrhizic acid‐derived carbon dots that inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of nonhuman primate‐derived MARC‐145, Vero, and pig kidney‐derived PK‐15 cells by suppressing viral genome replication and stimulating innate immune responses.[38] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint –1 BZM‐CDs.

Taking inspiration from how a wide range of biological materials have spiky surfaces for increased adhesion, one of the most recent advances has been the development of spiky nanostructures that have improved contact with virus particles (Figure 2d). Based on the complex topology of spherical influenza virus particles, including the presence of protruding glycoproteins, Nie et al. fabricated spiky silica nanoparticles that exhibited improved adhesion to the virus particles, as compared to smooth silica nanoparticles (Figure 2e).[39] The spike dimensions were optimized so that the nanoparticle spikes could fit well in between the glycoprotein protrusions (Figure 2f,g). Notably, however, the spiky silica nanoparticles had low aqueous dispersibility, so they were initially coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) but did not inhibit influenza virus infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK‐II cells in vitro. Therefore, the spiky silica nanoparticles were coated with a red blood cell membrane extract, which facilitated antiviral activity in vitro, as indicated by reduced virus particle binding to cells and decreased viral infectivity. Cell membrane coatings are further discussed in Section 4.3 below and this example provides insight into how the biological functionality of nanomaterials can be modulated based on the surface coating. A combination of binding ligands and antiviral drugs was further conjugated on the spiky nanoparticle surface to enhance antiviral activity against influenza virus and inhibit infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro.[40] Porous gold nanoparticles with a high surface area have also been reported to inhibit infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK cells by a wide range of influenza virus strains in vitro.[41] Ultimately, such studies have provided insight into how nanoparticle composition and shape can influence antiviral activity and this research direction has been greatly enhanced in recent years by integrating nanomaterial design together with biomimetic surface functionalization with cell‐mimicking receptors and cell membrane extracts. 4.2 Receptor‐Functionalized Nanomaterials 4.2.1 Sulfonated Nanoparticles Virus particle attachment to cell membrane receptors is a critical first step in the infection process and, for many types of viruses, involves viral protein binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors that are present on cell surfaces.[42] As such, stopping these virus‐cell binding interactions via competitive inhibitors can prevent infection and various classes of sulfonated polysaccharides have been explored, including heparin[43] and heparin‐like molecules[44] along with metal complexes of sulfonated molecules, and exhibit antiviral activity in vitro.[45] Many of these antiviral molecules have been explored as topical microbicides to prevent vaginal transmission of viruses such as HIV, however, none have demonstrated efficacy in late‐stage clinical trials and intracorporeal efficacy is more challenging to achieve.[46] In light of these shortcomings and the potential utility of this biomimetic design concept in principle, there has been extensive interest in developing sulfonated nanoparticles with a well‐controlled, multivalent presentation of sulfonate groups to inhibit susceptible viruses. Baram‐Pinto et al. reported that sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection of Vero cells in vitro by preventing cell entry of virus particles and hence reducing cell‐to‐cell spreading as well.[47] Notably, the sulfonate groups in that study were attached to gold nanoparticles via short‐chain linkers with low conformational flexibility. Cagno et al. further investigated the design of sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles with short‐chain, low‐flexibility and long‐chain, high‐flexibility linkers and discovered that the use of more flexible chains enabled improved antiviral activity in vitro with Vero cells, ex vivo with human epivaginal tissue cultures, and in vivo in mice (Figure 3a).[48] While both types of sulfonate‐functionalized nanoparticles could bind to and inhibit viruses such as HSV‐2, only the nanoparticles with flexible linkers could inhibit viruses upon dilution due to stronger binding interactions and heparin was also inactive (Figure 3b–d). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that nanoparticle‐virus particle interactions in the latter case resulted in virus particle disruption, indicating a virucidal (“virus‐killing”) type of mechanism (Figure 3e–g).

Sulfonate‐functionalized inorganic nanoparticles as virucidal inhibitors to disrupt virus particles. a) Schematic illustration of nanoparticle strategies to inhibit virus particles that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on cellular surfaces during the infection process. The basic concept is to create biomimetic nanoparticles with sulfonate groups that can tightly bind to virus particles to prevent virus binding to HSPG cell receptors. Top row: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with low‐flexibility 3‐mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES), termed MES‐AuNPs, can bind relatively weakly to virus particles to prevent infection. However, the inhibitory effect of MES‐AuNPs is lost upon dilution and the virus particles remain infective. Bottom: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with high‐flexibility undecanesulfonic acid (MUS), termed MUS‐AuNPs, can bind relatively strongly to virus particles and prevent infection.

Building on this work, Zacheo et al. recently explored how controlling the properties of the sulfonated ligands on the gold nanoparticle surface affects the degree of antiviral activity and identified glucose‐ and lactose‐based ligands with virucidal activity against Dengue virus to inhibit infection of Vero and human liver‐derived HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro.[49] Dey et al. have also reported the fabrication of ≈100–200 nm diameter, hydrogel‐like sulfonated nanogel particles and demonstrated that the nanogels can block HSV‐1 infection of monkey kidney‐derived Vero E6 cells in vitro.[50] Importantly, several types of nanogels were designed with different degrees of flexibility and more flexible nanogels showed greater antiviral activity. Cyclodextrin scaffolds functionalized with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids have also exhibited broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against numerous medically important viruses and further testing showed that HSV did not acquire resistance to the sulfonated cyclodextrin scaffolds.[51] The in vitro antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of money kidney‐derived Vero‐CCL81 and Vero E6 cells has been described in at least two recent works,[52] supporting that nanomaterial strategies involving sulfonate groups might be effective antiviral strategies to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 as well. 4.2.2 Sialylated Nanoparticles Different viruses bind to specific types of cell surface receptors as part of the infection process and another key example involves the influenza virus, which is a leading cause of respiratory viral infections.[53] Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins on the influenza virus particle surface bind to sialic acid‐containing glycan molecules that are prevalent on the surface of human lung cells as well as those of different animal species.[54] As with sulfonate‐related binding interactions and protein–glycan interactions in general, individual events of viral protein binding to sialic acids are relatively weak and strong interactions depend on multivalency.[55] Accordingly, a wide range of nanomaterial scaffolds with multiple sialic acid residues have been designed to competitively bind to influenza virus particles and thus prevent viral infection. Recent efforts have focused on how precisely tuning the distance between sialic acid residues on the scaffold affects HA binding. For example, Bandlow et al. investigated how rigid scaffolds composed of self‐assembled complexes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) enhanced binding interactions compared to more flexible, polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.[56] This finding agreed well with antiviral testing data on rigid and flexible core trivalent sialosides too.[57] Another important design variable has been considering linear versus branched scaffolds.[58] In one promising example, Kwon et al. reported the fabrication of a branched polyamidoamine scaffold that mirrored the inter‐spacing distance between HA proteins on influenza virus particles and intranasal administration of this scaffold was able to protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection.[59] Other recent examples include more sophisticated nanomaterial designs involving three‐way nucleic acid junctions[60] and star glycopolymers.[61] In addition to polymer‐like scaffolds, there has been ongoing exploration of sialic‐functionalized nanoparticles and a key example involves bacteriophage capsid nanoparticles with well‐controlled spacing of sialic acid‐functionalized ligands (Figure 4a,b).[62] Capsid nanoparticles with the correct Sia1 sialic acid ligands could specifically bind to influenza virus particles while nanoparticles functionalized with other glycan ligands did not bind to virus particles (Figure 4c,d). Likewise, only Sia1‐functionalized nanoparticles could inhibit influenza virus infection of MDCK‐II and human lung‐derived A549 cells in vitro in a dose‐dependent fashion and influenza virus pretreatment with the nanoparticles also protected mice from infection‐related weight loss in vivo (Figure 4e,f).

Richard et al. have also systematically investigated how sialic acid‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can be designed in terms of core nanoparticle size and linker length and unraveled how these parameters influence multivalent binding interactions, which can give rise to highly specific binding to particular ligand geometries.[63] In terms of soft‐matter nanoparticles, Bhatia et al. have also investigated the design of ≈250 nm diameter sialylated nanogel particles with varying degrees of flexibility and observed that highly flexible nanogel particles inhibited cell attachment of influenza virus by up to 400 times, as compared to more rigid nanogel particles.[64] The flexible nanogel particles also prevented influenza infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro down to picomolar concentrations. In another interesting example, Kong et al. reported the development of sialic acid‐functionalized lipid nanodisks that can bind to and cause perforation of influenza virus particles.[65] This example demonstrated that sialic acid‐functionalized nanoparticles can exhibit additional mechanistic functions beyond inhibiting virus‐cell interactions only and intravenous administration of the nanodisks also protected mice against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. In addition to new nanoparticle designs, there has been extensive recent progress in developing nanoscience measurement tools to quantify influenza viral protein‐sialic acid binding interactions. For example, single‐molecule force spectroscopy experiments have been conducted to comparatively measure the binding strength of influenza HA and neuraminidase proteins to sialic acid receptors[66] and the effects of multivalency on such interactions.[67] Di Iorio et al. have also fabricated sialic acid‐functionalized lipid bilayers and measured the binding of ≈22 nm diameter clusters of recombinant influenza HA proteins to supported lipid bilayers by quartz crystal microbalance‐dissipation (QCM‐D) experiments.[68] Other techniques such as microcavity arrays can also measure the diffusional motion of HA proteins bound to sialic acid‐functionalized supported lipid bilayers.[69] To date, most of these measurement strategies have been employed for understanding the fundamental role of multivalency in viral protein–glycan interactions while there remains tremendous potential to utilize these approaches for evaluating the functional performance of new nanomaterial inhibitors as well as to test drug inhibitor candidates that prevent such interactions.[70] 4.2.3 Additional Strategies In addition to glycan‐based decoy binding strategies for competitive inhibition, nucleic acid nanostructures have enabled creative design possibilities based on self‐assembling, complex topologies. For example, Kwon et al. reported the design of 3D DNA nanostructures with highly precise architectural features and incorporated Dengue viral protein‐binding aptamers within the nanostructure, which could bind multivalently to Dengue virus particles.[71] Different nanostructures such as heptagons, hexagons, and stars were tested and it was discovered that the star nanostructure yielded the most potent inhibitory activity to prevent Dengue virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to inhibit Dengue virus was around 2 × 10−9 m for star nanostructures, as compared to 10 × 10−9 and 440 × 10−9 m for the hexagon and heptagon nanostructures, respectively. This example provides an important demonstration of how synthetic receptors can be engineered in the future to develop more potent nanomaterial options, especially from natural, biocompatible materials, and with self‐assembling properties. These synthetic capabilities have also inspired current efforts to develop nanomaterial inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 based on understanding what receptor the virus binds and how to design receptor‐mimicking decoys. Specifically, the latest scientific evidence supports that SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the membrane‐associated angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell surfaces as part of the infection process.[72] Han et al. have reported the computational design of peptides that correspond to structurally important regions of ACE2 and can bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins to prevent infection.[73] It was suggested that the inhibitory peptides could be attached to nanoparticles with multivalent presentation, while such design strategies would require a careful consideration of how to best optimize the peptide attachment in terms of attachment chemistry, flexibility, density, and peptide conformation. There is also interest in engineering the ACE2 protein to bind more strongly to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins[74] and experimental work to test antiviral peptide inhibitors in this direction is ongoing. 4.3 Cell Membrane Decoys Over the past decade, there has been extensive and rapidly growing interest in coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane extracts to confer advantageous biological properties. For example, Hu et al. demonstrated that coating polymeric nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes can increase circulation time in mice.[75] It has also been demonstrated that cloaking polymeric nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of human platelets can improve immunocompatibility in terms of lower macrophage uptake and reduced complement activation, along with additional platelet‐like functionalities.[76] Ongoing progress in the field has also sparked interest in developing cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles that contain virus‐binding receptors and hence can bind to virus particles in order to prevent infection.[77] Numerous viruses such as Dengue and Zika are transmitted by mosquito vectors[78] and Rao et al. demonstrated that gelatin nanoparticles coated with mosquito cell membrane extracts can bind to Zika virus particles, whereby each ≈130 nm diameter nanoparticle binds to multiple virus particles.[79] This approach led to dose‐dependent reduction in viral infectivity of Vero cells in vitro and intravenous administration of the coated nanoparticles up to 2 days postinoculation also protected mice against virus‐induced mortality and body weight loss and reduced the level of viral infection in the brain. Red blood cell membrane‐coated magnetic nanoparticles with sialylated functional groups have also been employed to capture influenza virus particles.[80] In addition to using natural cell membrane extracts that contain typical amounts of virus‐binding receptors, there have been attempts to engineer cells to overexpress those receptors and to prepare cell‐derived membrane vesicles accordingly. For example, Liu et al. devised a biosynthetic strategy to overexpress the membrane receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is called human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), in HepG2 cells and prepared ≈200 nm diameter, cell membrane‐derived vesicles that were used to inhibit HBV infection of HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro and in mice with humanized livers in vivo (Figure 5a).[81] Compared to control membrane vesicles from the parent cell line with normal receptor quantities, the membrane vesicles from the engineered cell line with an overexpressed quantity of receptors exhibited appreciably greater antiviral activity levels and demonstrated improved treatment efficacy in the mouse model, as indicated by lower levels of HBV antibodies and nucleic acid copies (Figure 5b,c). Recently, Rao et al. reported the fabrication of cell membrane‐derived vesicles from human monocyte cells that were genetically engineered to express the ACE2 receptor and the ACE2‐functionalized vesicles could prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro.[82] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint [ 81 ] Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH. d) Strategy to capture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus particles by using cell‐membrane‐coated polymeric nanoparticles termed nanosponges (NS).

Similar approaches have also been taken to treat and prevent infection by HIV, which is known to infect T cells.[83] Polymeric nanoparticles were coated with the plasma membranes of CD4+ T cells, which contain the receptors needed for virus binding and cell entry, and the cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human‐monocyte‐derived macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, it was suggested that this cell membrane decoy strategy could be potentially advantageous to work against multiple, genetically diverse HIV strains because all strains bind to the same cell receptors.[85] A follow‐up study confirmed that the T cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit a wide range of HIV‐1 strains and surprisingly induced autophagy of HIV‐infected cells to suppress viral genome replication but had no effect on uninfected cells.[86] Recently, cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles have also been developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro (Figure 5d).[84] Nanoparticles coated with extracts from human lung epithelial type II or macrophage cells inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent fashion while nanoparticles coated with extracts from red blood cells were inactive (Figure 5e). These findings emphasize the importance of rationally designing biomimetic nanomaterial strategies based on a precise understanding of how a certain virus affects cells, and further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of these inhibitory capabilities in vivo.

5 Viral Membrane Inhibitors Most nanomaterial‐based antiviral strategies focus on targeting viral protein components in order to prevent virus‐cell binding interactions as described in the preceding examples. However, various types of viruses use distinct binding receptors to enter cells and such strategies are therefore intrinsically limited to working against a relatively narrow subset of viruses. On the other hand, many viral epidemics are caused by membrane‐enveloped viruses and a structurally intact viral membrane on enveloped viruses is necessary for viral infectivity, including virus‐cell fusion.[87] As such, a wide range of broad‐spectrum antiviral drug candidates have been explored to inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses based on targeting the viral membrane.[87] One of the most exciting groups of drug candidates within this class are membrane‐disruptive, antiviral peptides that inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses in order to abrogate viral infectivity.[88] Several antiviral peptides have been discovered that inhibit a wide range of membrane‐enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)[89] and HIV,[90] and include a 27‐mer amphipathic, α‐helical (AH) peptide that exhibits membrane‐curvature‐selective disruptive activity to inhibit small, membrane‐enveloped virus particles of ≈160 nm diameter or smaller.[91] In vitro antiviral testing experiments against various types of membrane‐enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have been conducted using a wide range of permissive, model cell lines such as Vero cells and human liver‐derived Huh 7.5 cells as well as primary cells such as mouse neuronal cells and human T cells. The results have demonstrated that some membrane‐active peptides exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses down to the nanomolar range along with low cell cytotoxicity.[92] While viral envelopes are derived from host cell membranes, the AH peptide and possibly other peptides can exhibit selective rupture of highly curved viral membranes due to membrane‐curvature‐triggered membrane disruption.[93] Indeed, mammalian cells are much larger than virus particles and hence possess an appreciably lower degree of membrane curvature and this curvature difference provides a distinguishing factor between viral and mammalian cell membranes.[94] These promising mechanistic features have motivated researchers to explore how to utilize viral‐membrane‐targeting, antiviral peptides in vivo, while exploring design strategies to overcome traditional challenges of peptide therapeutics, such as high susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and short circulation time.[95] To overcome these challenges, Jackman et al. explored the development of an engineered version of the AH peptide, composed of all D‐amino acids and termed AH‐D, which was able to therapeutically treat lethal Zika virus infection in a mouse model in vivo.[92] The basic design concept was called lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD) and posited that extracellular targeting of membrane‐enveloped viruses can reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in order to help curb viral infection (Figure 6a). Upon intravenous administration of the AH‐D peptide starting 3 days post‐virus inoculation, over 80% of mice survived Zika virus infection and exhibited markedly reduced clinical symptoms in general. Importantly, the AH‐D peptide was able to significantly reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in the blood as well as in multiple organs, including in the brain (Figure 6b). More extensive studies revealed that the AH‐D peptide is able to cross the intact blood‐brain barrier to treat Zika virus infection directly in the brain as well as to reduce infection‐related brain inflammation (Figure 6c,d).

From a material science perspective, another noteworthy point is that a large portion of the mechanistic understanding about how AH and AH‐D peptides work has been obtained from biosensing measurement strategies involving biomimetic, virus‐particle‐mimicking vesicles in combination with acoustic‐, optical‐, nanoplasmonic‐, and fluorescence‐microscopy‐based techniques.[91, 96] Examples include nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and plasmonic nanohole sensors[97] (Figure 6e–i). Such insights have led to further exploration of the AH‐D peptide as an antiviral drug candidate to prevent Zika virus infection of fetuses in pregnant mice[98] and forward‐looking discussion about how the LEAD concept could be useful for broadly treating mosquito‐borne virus infections, including not only Zika but also Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever among various possibilities.[99] This capability could be especially beneficial when a mosquito‐borne viral infection is clinically suspected but a differential diagnosis of the specific virus type is challenging.[100] The LEAD concept might be generally applicable to other types of membrane‐enveloped viruses as well since the viral membrane represents an Achilles heel and there is a high barrier to the emergence of drug‐resistant strains because the viral membrane is derived from host cell membranes and not encoded within the viral genome.[101] It has even been suggested that membrane‐enveloped SARS‐CoV‐2 might be susceptible to viral membrane disruption[102] and these aspects are particularly important because SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the brain has been linked to a wide range of COVID‐19 disease conditions.[103] While intravenously administered, antiviral peptides have demonstrated initial promise in some mouse models of viral infections, nanomaterial‐based drug delivery strategies could improve pharmacological activities and lead to improved targeting possibilities. Zhang et al. have reported the development of a cationic, membrane‐active antiviral peptide that was mixed together with anionic polymer chains to form ≈35 nm diameter nanoparticles.[104] These peptide‐polymer nanoparticles exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against HCV infection of Huh 7.5 cells and HIV infection of TZM‐bl cells, human lymphocytes, and monocyte‐derived macrophages, respectively, and also showed lower levels of hemolytic activity against red blood cells than the free peptide alone. Intramuscular injection of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles showed improved treatment of HIV‐1 infection in a mouse model in vivo, as compared to free peptide alone. In a follow‐up study, a refined version of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles was developed that was functionalized with galactosyl sugar molecules in order to enable improved HepG2 cell internalization in vitro and preferential liver accumulation in mice in vivo.[105] Ongoing work can further expand the potential of targeting membrane‐enveloped viruses by using antiviral peptides and other classes of small‐molecule inhibitors[106] that impair viral membrane‐associated proteins to prevent virus‐cell fusion in combination with nanomaterial strategies to enhance targeted delivery prospects. In addition to directly targeting virus particles, it might be possible to also disrupt membrane‐enveloped exosomes that carry viral components such as nucleic acids and proteins and can be involved in viral infection and transmission processes.[107]

6 Virus‐Removing Blood Filters Another approach to effectively remove circulating virus particles from the blood of infected hosts has relied on the use of extracorporeal blood‐filtering devices and advances upon medical device technology that was originally used to treat sepsis infections.[108] Early work by Kang et al. demonstrated that a microfluidic device can effectively remove a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood.[109] To achieve this objective, ≈130 nm diameter magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) protein molecules, which can bind to sugar molecules found on the surface of various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses along with endotoxins.[110] The MBL‐functionalized nanoparticles were mixed together with circulating blood, could bind to circulating pathogens, and then the nanoparticle‐pathogen mixtures could be magnetically separated before the blood was returned to the host. In rat models of bacterial infection, more than 90% of bacteria were reduced along with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Seiler et al. have further explored the use of an engineered version of MBL that demonstrated improved pathogen capture in blood and urine samples.[111] Based on these findings, there has been ongoing progress to develop extracorporeal blood filters for virus particle removal applications as well. Tullis et al. demonstrated that hemodialysis treatment using a hollow‐fiber cartridge that contained antibody‐functionalized agarose beads could effectively remove HIV‐1 virus particles and viral proteins from cell culture media and blood.[112] These capabilities have led to the exploration of clinical‐stage medical device technology to broadly capture a wide range of circulating virus particles by replacing the antibody functionalization with MBL functionalization. Early reports indicated preliminary testing success to capture HIV and HCV virus particles along with binding to Dengue, influenza, Ebola, and Marburg viral proteins.[113] A pilot human clinical trial using a full‐scale version of this medical device technology was used to remove HCV from the blood of 4 HCV‐positive patients and resulted in an average drop in HCV viral loads of around 57%.[114] Follow‐up studies showed HCV viral load reductions in additional patients and it was further suggested that continuous application of this treatment approach could potentially reduce HCV to clinically undetectable levels within a few days, especially if used in combination with conventional antiviral drug therapies.[115] Büttner et al. have also reported that the medical device technology has been used to treat one patient with Ebola virus infection[116] and recent works have explored how these extracorporeal blood filters might be useful to remove coronaviruses and Marburg virus from infected blood.[117] With respect to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it has also been noted that virus‐removing blood filters could be a useful technology.[118] Given the small number of patients in the aforementioned clinical testing, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present stage, however, there are bright prospects to continue exploring virus‐removing blood filter technology. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the initiation of a feasibility study, with up to 40 human patients, to test the treatment efficacy of an extracorporeal blood filter based on this medical device technology for patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis and severe COVID‐19 disease.[119] In terms of future innovation in this direction, it is important to continue exploring how to develop improved filtration devices while also creating new biofunctionalization strategies to improve virus‐binding capacity and perhaps apply peptide functionalization schemes to catalytically damage virus particles as opposed to intact virus particle binding alone. Looking forward, these medical device technologies can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antiviral drug therapies to lower the amount of infectious virus particles in blood while also inhibiting the production of new virus particles among other possibilities.

7 Virus‐Mimicking Nanoparticle Vaccines 7.1 Design Rationale There has also been tremendous progress in developing nanoparticle‐based vaccine strategies to prevent and treat viral infections. In general, viral infections provoke the immune system, which can recognize viral proteins on the virus particle surface (“antigens”) and produce antibodies that bind to these antigens to neutralize virus particles.[120] In some cases, natural antibodies produced in response to a viral infection can have extremely high specificity and potency to inhibit virus particles.[121] For these reasons, the blood plasma from patients who recover from a certain type of virus infection is often given as a medical treatment to infected patients afflicted with the same type of virus infection.[122] In such cases, the plasma can contain high levels of neutralizing antibodies that bind to and inhibit virus particles.[123] However, the specific types and concentrations of antibodies present in blood plasma vary from person‐to‐person, potentially limiting reliable clinical use.[124] Hence, there has been extensive interest in recombinantly manufacturing specific, highly potent neutralizing antibodies as an alternative treatment option.[125] This latter approach allows more precise control over antibody composition and dosing. Recombinant antibody therapies also reduce the risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, which can arise in some cases from non‐neutralizing antibodies that are also present in plasma.[125, 126] The same logic applies to vaccine development where the key objective is to administer a virus‐mimicking immunogenic material so that a strong and focused immune response can be trained. The target objective is to generate high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies while minimizing production of non‐neutralizing antibodies that can otherwise inadvertently promote virus infection in some cases. Over the past few years, virus‐mimicking nanomaterial design strategies have been at the forefront of creating next‐generation vaccine strategies now reaching human clinical trials. The combination of nanomaterials, biomimetics, and protein engineering has led to unprecedented capabilities to rationally finetune immune responses and elicit high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies in a safe and effective manner. These capabilities are currently being extended to develop a nanoparticle vaccine candidate to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Recent progress in the field highlights the merits of both natural and engineered protein scaffolds to create self‐assembling, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines with excellent biomechanical and immunological properties. The fast‐moving progress on this subject is reviewed in this section along with coverage of other vaccine nanoparticle strategies. 7.2 Types of Nanoparticle Vaccines There is broad interest in integrating material science and protein engineering strategies to develop safe, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines that present viral protein antigens in a highly organized and symmetrical manner in order to induce strong immune responses.[127] Compared to free antigens, nanoparticle vaccines have several compelling advantages, including greater antigen stability, multivalent presentation of antigens, and targeted delivery.[128] As such, nanoparticle vaccines can bind multivalently to multiple receptors on B cells, which are immune cells involved in antibody production, resulting in more robust immune responses and high levels of immune protection.[24] A wide variety of nanoparticle types are being explored to prevent infectious diseases in general, including self‐assembling protein nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomal nanoparticles, and polymer scaffolds.[129] Key design considerations include optimizing the antigen structure (more precisely, the immunogen structure) to elicit the desired immune response, tuning vaccine delivery, and inducing focused immune responses.[130] From a biomimetic perspective, one of the most promising recent design advances has involved self‐assembled nanoparticle vaccines as discussed below along with introducing other nanoparticle vaccine design strategies. 7.2.1 Natural Protein Scaffolds The earliest example of a natural protein scaffold to form a nanoparticle vaccine involved the use of ferritin, which self‐assembles into nearly spherical, hollow nanoparticles that have ≈12 nm core diameter and are composed of 24 protein molecules with symmetrical organization.[131] By overcoming several challenges related to protein glycosylation and oligomerization, Kanekiyo et al. first reported the design of a ferritin‐based, influenza nanoparticle vaccine in 2013 that presented eight trimers of influenza HA viral protein on the nanoparticle surface in a native‐like configuration that enabled a superior immune response to conventionally used influenza vaccine strategies based on inactivated virus particles.[132] From a material science perspective, the key innovation was controlling the location at which ferritin and HA were genetically fused together in order to recombinantly express ferritin‐HA fusion proteins that self‐assembled into nanoparticles with repetitively spaced, trimeric HA spikes (Figure 7a,b). Ferritin‐HA nanoparticle immunization induced a strong immune response, as indicated by high levels of neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza H1N1 strains and protection against influenza virus infection in a ferret model (Figure 7c,d). Recently, Kelly et al. have elucidated how ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccination in mice triggers principally germinal center expansion and maturation of memory B cells, which are involved in antibody production.[133] In another study, Yassine et al. further explored the development of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines that presented a truncated version of HA, which corresponded to the stem region that is conserved across different HA subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and hence its trimeric presentation on the nanoparticle surface conferred protection against a wider range of influenza subtypes in mouse and ferret models.[134] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ).

Ferritin nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed to prevent infections from viruses such as HIV‐1 and Sliepen et al. first reported the design of ferritin nanoparticles presenting HIV‐1 envelope (Env) protein trimers, which demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity in mice and rabbits.[136] Neutralizing antibodies were generated to inhibit some but not all HIV‐1 strains, and it was particularly challenging to inhibit certain strains classified as “difficult‐to‐neutralize”.[137] It was discussed how the nanoparticle design might be improved by reducing steric hindrance between adjacent Env trimers. He et al. refined the structure‐based design of the trimeric Env antigens presented on the ferritin nanoparticle surface along with optimizing spacing between the trimers in order to yield more robust B cell responses.[138] More detailed engineering of the Env antigen structure increased Env trimer recognition on the ferritin nanoparticles by a broader range of naïve B cells, resulting in elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.[139] Due to the high sequence variation among Env proteins across different HIV‐1 strains, Sliepen et al. have designed a new Env antigen structure based on a consequence sequence incorporating the epitopes of many broadly neutralizing antibodies, and presented the Env antigen trimers on ferritin nanoparticles to yield strong neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits and macaques.[140] In addition, He et al. have reported additional protein engineering efforts to improve the stability of wild‐type Env antigens by switching out the ectodomain with a more stable version from an engineered Env antigen, which enabled improved generation of neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit difficult‐to‐neutralize HIV‐1 strains, in mice and rabbits.[141] Together, the ongoing work with ferritin‐Env nanoparticle vaccines to prevent HIV‐1 infection demonstrates the superior immune responses generated by antigen trimers on the nanoparticle surface, while highlighting the potential to combine these nanomaterial efforts with antigen‐based protein engineering efforts. Such possibilities have also been explored for a wide range of other viruses and support the broad versatility of ferritin nanoparticle technology for developing next‐generation vaccines. Kanekiyo et al. have designed a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) infection by conjugating ferritin molecules to a truncated domain from the EBV gp350 protein that contains the receptor‐binding site needed for B cell infection.[142] On the ferritin nanoparticle surface, the antigen formed dimers, which is a distinct conformation to the trimeric presentation cases discussed above. Importantly, compared to the soluble gp350 antigen, the nanoparticle vaccine still elicited markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies by 10‐ to 100‐fold in mice and nonhuman primates and also conferred protective immunity on mice in a lethal virus challenge model. Bu et al. have also developed another form of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent EBV infection based on a different antigen (gH), which alone and in complexation with gL and gp42 proteins helps to generate neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus‐cell fusion and works against multiple cell types instead of only preventing B cell infection.[143] In another important example, Wang et al. have reported a dual‐targeting, ferritin nanoparticle vaccine strategy to prevent and treat chronic HBV infection in mice based on activating two types of immune cells to induce high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibodies.[144] Recent work has further demonstrated that ferritin nanoparticles are an excellent platform to present viral antigens for developing HCV vaccines that might work against a wide range of HCV genotypes[145] and also to develop vaccines for treating RSV infection.[146] Notably, in the latter case, a glycosylated version of the RSV antigen was designed that induced a higher ratio of neutralizing antibodies to non‐neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates, which could be significant because higher levels of non‐neutralizing antibodies are thought to be associated with antibody‐mediated disease enhancement.[146] In addition to fabricating ferritin nanoparticles composed of one type of building block component, there has been interest in developing two‐component ferritin nanoparticles in order to present oligomers of multiple antigens on the nanoparticle surface. For example, Georgiev et al. reported the development of ferritin nanoparticles composed of two types of ferritin constructs, one of which was fused to an influenza virus antigen and the other one of which was fused to an HIV‐1 antigen, and nanoparticle self‐assembly resulted in trimeric presentation of both antigens.[147] Importantly, vaccination with this nanoparticle strategy in guinea pigs could induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibited both viruses. Since there are many different subtypes of influenza virus, Kanekiyo et al. expanded on this nanoparticle design strategy to design and coassemble ferritin‐HA constructs encoding HA with one of two receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) and the resulting nanoparticles had mosaic HA trimers that presented a mixture of RBDs to yield a broader antibody response than nanoparticles with either RBD alone.[148] Vaccination in mice led to the discovery of a neutralizing antibody that works against a wide range of influenza virus strains. Accordingly, nanoparticle‐based strategies presenting multiple antigens have been suggested as one possible route to create a universal influenza vaccine.[25] While ferritin nanoparticles have proven useful for creating vaccine nanoparticle technology, there has been extensive interest in identifying other natural protein scaffolds that can self‐assemble into nanoparticles with different sizes. Also in 2013, Jardine et al. reported the development of ≈32 nm diameter, self‐assembling nanoparticles composed of 60 recombinantly expressed lumazine synthase (LS) protein molecules from Aquifex aeolicus, which exhibit symmetrical organization, and designed an LS fusion protein together with HIV‐1 Env antigen that could form nanoparticles with enhanced B cell activation and lymph node trafficking properties.[149] In follow‐up work, an improved version of the LS nanoparticle vaccine platform was designed and induced promising immune responses in different mouse models in vivo, toward the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV‐1 infection.[150] Havenar‐Daughton et al. further investigated single‐dose immunization of rhesus monkeys with this HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccine and noted that subcutaneous immunization yielded markedly larger B cell responses and lymph node drainage than intramuscular drainage.[151] Tokatlian et al. have also explored how antigen glycosylation of LS‐ and ferritin‐based HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines is an important factor in modulating antibody responses (Figure 7e,f).[135] The results demonstrated that antigen glycosylation is an important factor in eliciting high levels of antigen‐specific antibody levels and appreciably lower levels were observed with deglycosylated antigen (Figure 7g). Additionally, Krebs et al. have investigated ≈23 nm diameter nanoparticle self‐assembly from the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in order to create nanoparticle vaccines presenting an HIV‐1 Env antigen fragment, which yielded an antigen‐specific antibody in immunized rabbits although multiple rounds of immunization were needed to elicit moderately protective, neutralizing antibody levels in a large fraction of rabbits.[152] As seen in these examples, it is important to point out that self‐assembled nanoparticles from different natural protein scaffolds have distinct functionalities, as noted by how protein scaffolds fused together with full‐length viral protein antigens can only self‐assemble into nanoparticles for some, but not all, of the scaffold options and antigen spacing is another important factor affecting both nanoparticle self‐assembly and immunogenicity.[138] In part, such design issues have motivated the use of full‐length viral proteins or truncated versions thereof and the type of nanoparticle structure can also affect antigen oligomerization in some cases.[142] Another important point concerns the nanoparticle vaccine fabrication strategy. To date, the structural components of virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines have been recombinantly expressed in host cells in vitro and, upon expression, spontaneously self‐assemble into antigen‐presenting nanoparticles. In such cases, the nanoparticle vaccine suspension is then injected into animals as part of the immunization process. As an alternative strategy, recent work has also investigated nucleic‐acid‐based vaccination strategies that could enable the in vivo expression of nanoparticle structural components and, in some cases, in vivo self‐assembly of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. Melo et al. reported the development of a lipid‐nanoparticle‐encapsulated alphavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) replicon encoding the HIV Env antigen fused with LS.[153] A single injection of this lipid nanoparticle suspension encoding the HIV Env antigen yielded high levels of Env‐specific antibodies and also led to improved B cell responses compared to recombinant protein immunization. In another demonstration, Xu et al. reported the use of a DNA vaccine plasmid to induce the in vivo expression of a nanoparticle structural component comprising an HIV Env antigen fused with LS, and demonstrated its in vivo structural assembly in mice based on functional studies along with improved immune responses in mice and guinea pigs compared to immunization with a similar delivery strategy encoding antigen monomers only.[154] The design concept was further generalized to other natural protein scaffolds, such as ferritin nanoparticles, which also induced high immune responses and the delivery strategy could also be adapted to influenza HA antigen in order to endow mice with protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge. From a translational perspective, there has been tremendous progress in developing ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccines for preventing influenza infections based on ongoing human clinical trials being conducted in the United States. Preliminary data from the first‐in‐human trial (NCT03186781) of a ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccine provided initial evidence that the vaccine is safe and well‐tolerated in humans while another human clinical trial (NCT03814720) is ongoing to evaluate the dosing, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ferritin‐HA‐stem nanoparticles as a potential universal flu vaccine candidate. 7.2.2 Engineered Protein Scaffolds The insights gained from nanoparticle vaccines based on self‐assembling natural protein scaffolds have highlighted the importance of tuning antigen structure, conformation, density, and spacing on the nanoparticle surface. While several types of self‐assembling proteins exist in nature, the number of options is intrinsically limited, which has prompted researchers to further explore the design of nanoparticle vaccines from self‐assembling, engineered protein scaffolds that enable greater control over nanomaterial properties. Toward this goal, King et al. reported computational strategies to design 24‐subunit protein nanomaterials composed of two types of self‐assembling protein subunit components, and experimentally demonstrated that it was possible to rationally tune the nanomaterial structure, shape, and symmetry in alignment with the computational designs.[155] In another study, Bale et al. applied similar approaches to design larger, two‐component protein nanomaterials composed of 120 subunits with icosahedral symmetry and had 24–40 nm diameters that are similar to the size of small viral capsids.[156] Another advantage of using two‐component engineered proteins is greater control over the fabrication process. Natural protein scaffolds self‐assemble upon recombinant expression while engineered protein components can be expressed independently and then mixed as desired to self‐assemble into nanoparticles in vitro. Marcandalli et al. reported the first example of an engineered‐protein‐based nanoparticle vaccine that was built from two self‐assembling components and presented multiple copies of a trimeric RSV envelope antigen termed DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8a,b).[157] One protein component was designed to present DS‐Cav1 and spontaneously formed trimers by itself, while the other protein component formed pentamers by itself. The two protein components were expressed independently and, when mixed together in vitro, 20 trimers of the first protein component and 12 pentamers of the second protein component self‐assembled to form two‐component nanoparticles with ≈55 nm diameter inclusive of the antigen trimer spikes. Unlike previous nanoparticle vaccine designs, it was possible to control the density of DS‐Cav1 antigen trimer on the nanoparticle surface based on mixing different amounts of the first protein component with a genetically fused version of the first protein component that presents DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8c). Importantly, the nanoparticle presentation of DS‐Cav1 trimers not only improved antigen physical stability but also nanoparticle vaccine immunization in mice and nonhuman primates led to nearly 10‐fold higher neutralizing antibody titers along with a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response than immunization with soluble DS‐Cav1 trimers (Figure 8d). Brouwer et al. have also used a similar two‐component nanoparticle strategy to present HIV‐1 envelope antigen trimers.[158] In this case, the two‐component nanoparticle induced particularly high antibody responses after a single round of immunization, as compared to the same antigen trimers in soluble form and displayed on single‐component ferritin nanoparticles. There is ongoing exploration of different nanoparticle shape designs[159] and how nanoparticle formulations can improve lymph node targeting in nonhuman primate models.[160] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ) and the bar indicates the geometric mean, which is listed for each test group.

In terms of COVID‐19 vaccine development, Walls et al. recently reported the development of a two‐component nanoparticle vaccine candidate that displays the RBD of a SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope protein antigen (Figure 8e).[161] From a nanomaterial design perspective, a key innovation was introducing a genetically encoded flexible linker to connect the smaller RBD domain with the main nanoparticle structure. It is also noteworthy that the basic self‐assembling nanoparticle design involved the same two protein components as in the RSV and HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines described above, demonstrating the modular nature of nanoparticle vaccines and the ability to rationally swap antigens to support rapid vaccine development (Figure 8f). Importantly, the COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine induced nearly ten‐fold greater neutralizing antibody titers in mice than a soluble antigen trimer even when the nanoparticles were administered at a five‐time lower dose (Figure 8g). The nanoparticle vaccine also induced a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response, as compared to human convalescent sera. This immune response resulted in complete protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an in vivo virus challenge mouse model (Figure 8h). The combination of these features has further spurred ongoing manufacturing efforts to create a COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine in abundant quantities for potential human clinical trials. Looking forward, Ueda et al. have also continued designing new nanoparticle vaccine designs that are tailored for different types of viral protein domains[157] and there is excellent potential to continue exploring protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. As control over the molecular‐level biomimetic features of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines continues to improve, there will be growing emphasis on production scalability and how these nanoparticle vaccines can compete with other vaccine candidates in terms of practical factors such as cost, storage, and scalability. 7.2.3 Additional Scaffold Options While there has been tremendous progress in developing protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines to prevent viral infections, liposome‐ and inorganic nanoparticle‐based strategies have also proven advantageous and demonstrate important nanomaterial desi



Biomimetic Nanomaterial Strategies for Virus Targeting: Antiviral Therapies and VaccinesBiomimetic nanomaterials have excellent potential to combat viral infections and lay the groundwork for next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

Since virus particles are nanoscale entities, nanomaterial design strategies are ideally suited to create advanced materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles. In this progress report, the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials are critically discussed for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Particular focus is placed on nanomaterial design concepts and material innovations that can be readily developed to thwart future viral threats. Pertinent nanomaterial examples from the COVID‐19 situation are also covered along with discussion of human clinical trial efforts underway that might lead to next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there have been growing calls to recognize that emerging infectious diseases represent a major threat to global health and that we must be better prepared to deal with a future viral pandemic, which could arise from an unknown or understudied virus.[1] In 2018, the World Health Organization expanded on these viewpoints by preparing a list of viral and nonviral pathogens that could cause Disease X, a future human disease outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential that would be triggered by a newly emerged pathogen.[2] In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic arose as the first Disease X and was caused by the global spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has infected over 39 million people and caused over 1 100 000 deaths to date.[3] COVID‐19 is considered by some experts to be a once‐in‐a‐century pandemic[4] and has highlighted how viral pandemics can create a perfect storm of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that is disrupting the institutions of daily life worldwide, including work, healthcare, education, and transportation.[5] Our understanding of COVID‐19 continues to grow since a local outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and led to the discovery of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is related to other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[6] SARS‐CoV‐2 is believed to be a zoonotic virus that crossed over from bats[7] and acquired mutations via natural selection that caused the virus to more efficiently infect human cells and transmit among humans.[8] Early reports of human respiratory disease[9] have since been followed up by numerous, ongoing studies to gain further insight into COVID‐19 disease pathogenesis, including how severe cases of COVID‐19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.[10] Various organs are affected by the disease, including lungs,[11] heart,[12] liver,[13] kidney,[14] and brain.[15] As such, there has been tremendous attention placed on the treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and growing attention to the role that materials science can play in stopping COVID‐19 and, more broadly, the wide range of viral infections affecting global society along with future viral threats.[16] The objective of this progress report is to cover the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Major emphasis is placed on covering the most recent developments mainly within the past three years, while distilling key nanomaterial design principles that can lead to next‐generation advanced materials for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Where applicable, we also discuss how these nanomaterial strategies are being explored to stop SARS‐CoV‐2 along with coverage of relevant human clinical trial efforts.

2 Advanced Materials for Virus Targeting Virus particles (“virions”) are biological nanoparticles that contain viral genetic material and are surrounded by a protein or lipid bilayer membrane coating. The particles are typically around 50–300 nm in diameter and are functionalized with glycoproteins that play an important role in binding to cells.[17] There are two main types: enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Membrane‐enveloped viruses are surrounded by a host‐cell‐derived lipid membrane that contains embedded glycoproteins while nonenveloped viruses have a protein‐based capsid shell without lipid membrane.[18] In both cases, the glycoproteins on the virus particle surface are the major antigens, which are recognized by the host immune system and can elicit an antibody response.[19] Once the immune system is trained to recognize a viral antigen, the immune system can rapidly produce antibodies that bind to the virus particles and prevent them from causing infection.[20] Fundamentally, virus particles are parasites that must infect susceptible cells and highjack cellular machinery in order to produce new virus particles.[21] The basic steps are presented in Scheme 1a. The first step involves virus particle binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface, which can result in cellular entry and start of the infection process. Each type of cell has a characteristic pattern of receptors found on the cellular surface and different viruses bind preferentially to particular ones. For example, many viruses bind specifically to glycan‐functionalized receptors containing sulfonate or sialyl functional groups. Infected cells produce new copies of viral genetic material and viral proteins, which are then assembled in order to produce new virus particles that are released extracellularly and infect new cells. The process continues indefinitely until an organism succumbs to virus‐induced cellular damage and related immune responses, and viruses can also spread between organisms via a wide range of transmission mechanisms.

The replication machinery of infected cells is highjacked by viruses and used to create new copies of the viral genome and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles that are released from the cell and spread to infect other cells. b) Examples of different nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. i) Nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors can inhibit the production of new virus particles. ii) Virus‐binding nanoparticles and iii) cell membrane decoys can bind to virus particles and prevent viral infection of cells. iv) Viral membrane inhibitors can disrupt membrane‐enveloped virus particles, abrogating infectivity. v) Extracorporeal blood filters can remove circulating virus particles from the bloodstream to reduce disease burden. vi) Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines that mimic the multivalent presentation of antigens on virus particle surfaces can elicit improved immune responses that lead to greater protection against future virus exposure. Depending on the objective, various nanomaterial strategies can be useful to stop viruses, as presented in Scheme 1b. Conventionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to inhibit viral genome replication inside infected cells, thereby preventing the production of new virus particles.[22] Nanomaterial strategies have proven useful to enhance the pharmacological properties of viral genome replication inhibitors, including circulation time. While it is advantageous to stop viral genome replication in order to help treat existing viral infections, there is also extensive interest in exploring how nanomaterials can be useful to prevent viral infections.[23] Virus‐binding nanomaterials can attach to virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells. Pristine nanomaterials can be used along with receptor‐functionalized ones and cell‐membrane‐decoy nanomaterials, which are coated with cell membrane extracts containing natural receptors. Ongoing efforts have also devised nanomaterial‐based strategies to effectively remove extracellular virus particles from infected organisms by either selectively disrupting virus particles or by removing them through extracorporeal filtration strategies. Moreover, some of the most recent and innovative advances have come from developing nanoparticle vaccines, especially self‐assembling protein‐based ones, which have demonstrated excellent potential to prevent multiple types of viral infections.[24] One of the most promising candidates has been rapidly advanced into human clinical trials as a potential universal flu vaccine[25] and similar strategies are now being applied to SARS‐CoV‐2. A key innovative aspect of these nanoparticle vaccines is that critical architectural properties of virus particles, particularly the specific organization of glycoprotein antigens, can now be mimicked with nanoscale precision and these advanced material capabilities have led to nanoparticle vaccine candidates with superior immunizing capabilities to currently used vaccine strategies in some cases. The latest progress in all of these areas is covered in the following sections.

3 Viral Replication Inhibitors The most widely used class of direct‐acting antiviral drugs encompasses small molecules that inhibit the genome replication of viruses inside infected cells.[26] These replication processes involve a multiprotein replication complex called the viral replicase[27] and antiviral therapy often targets one or more types of the viral proteins that form this complex. Key examples of antiviral drugs in this class include nucleoside and nucleotide analogues that inhibit the viral polymerase, which is the main enzyme involved in viral genome production.[28] Over the years, there have been extensive efforts to develop prodrugs[29]—inactive molecules that are metabolized into the active drug in vivo—and drug delivery systems that enable longer circulation time, targeted delivery, and/or improved safety of viral replication inhibitors, in line with broader innovation trends in the nanomedicine field as a whole. Promising examples include development of a once weekly, orally administered antiviral drug delivery platform that consists of several polymer matrices with different drug release profiles in order to consistently maintain pharmaceutically relevant concentrations of antiviral drugs in systemic circulation.[30] One of the most recent examples of cutting‐edge nanomaterial strategies to deliver viral replication inhibitors involves the class of macromolecular prodrugs, comprising polymer‐functionalized antiviral drugs in complexation with serum proteins. Andersen et al. described the formation of polymer–protein–drug complexes that enable long‐duration therapy with multiple antiviral drugs.[31] A polymer–protein complex comprised of a single, ≈7 kDa N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (PHPMA) chain per covalently attached albumin molecule was designed and exhibited much longer circulation half‐time and higher concentrations in mice upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as compared to free PHPMA alone. Marked accumulation of the polymer–protein complex in mouse lymph nodes was also reported. Two antiviral drugs, azidothymidine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), were covalently incorporated into the monomer backbone via a labile disulfide linkage for eventual intracellular release of free drug molecules. These functionalized building blocks were assembled into a colloidal‐like polymer–protein–drug complex consisting of one polymer chain with six AZT and four 3TC copies along with one albumin molecule and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human T cells in vitro. Frich et al. expanded on this macromolecular prodrug strategy by devising a “hitchhiking” scheme in which a polymer–drug conjugate was fabricated and exhibited noncovalent binding to serum albumin proteins, as indicated by biophysical experiments and increased circulation half‐time in mice in vivo.[32] The key innovation was functionalizing the PHPMA component with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) lipid, which is a binding ligand for serum albumin proteins found in circulation (Figure 1a). A polymer–drug conjugate was synthesized consisting of DSPE–PHPMA and multiple copies of acyclovir (ACV), which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpes simplex virus (HSV). It was verified that free ACV could be released from the DSPE–PHPMA–ACV complex upon incubation in physiologically relevant conditions containing glutathione (GSH). It was determined that >100 × 10−9 m ACV was released within 3 h from 1 g L–1 PHPMA–ACV in GSH‐containing phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) while nearly negligible release was observed over an appreciably longer time period of 24 h in PBS without GSH. Importantly, DSPE–PHPMA–ACV also exhibited antiviral activity against HSV type 2 (HSV‐2) infection of baby hamster kidney‐derived ELVIS and human cervix‐derived HeLa cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous administration of the polymer–drug complex helped to suppress vaginal HSV‐2 infection in an in vivo mouse model based on viral infectivity measurements of vaginal wash and spinal cord specimens (Figure 1b).

DSPE‐PHPMA was found to bind noncovalently to serum albumin proteins, which was associated with a longer circulation half‐time in mice. By contrast, PHPMA alone did not bind appreciably to albumins. b) Effect of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered DSPE‐PHPMA‐ACV, PHPMA‐ACV, free ACV, and no treatment (N.t.) on vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2) infection in an in vivo mouse model.

In addition to forming polymer–drug complexes, recent efforts have focused on creating macromolecular prodrugs from chemical derivatives of nucleoside analogues that can form nucleic acid scaffolds. For example, Krüger et al. demonstrated that idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to treat HSV infection, could be converted into a phosphoramidite derivative and then these building blocks were used to synthesize linear nucleic acid scaffolds with 7 or 14 attached drug molecules (Figure 1c).[33] In vitro release experiments revealed that the scaffolds are stable in serum‐free cell culture medium while free idoxuridine was gradually released within 2–6 h in the presence of serum, indicating the potential utility of these scaffolds for in vivo applications (Figure 1d). Future work needs to continue exploring the prophylactic and therapeutic utility of macromolecular prodrugs of viral replication inhibitors in animal models, while there exist numerous potential advantages in terms of well‐defined colloidal properties and targeted codelivery of two or more antiviral drugs to increase the barrier for drug‐resistant virus strains to emerge.[34] There also remains an outstanding need to investigate the mechanisms of drug release in vivo and to also continue exploring how macromolecular prodrugs can be engineered to target specific organs.

4 Virus Particle Binding Inhibitors 4.1 Pristine Nanomaterials Over the years, various classes of nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based nanomaterials have been synthesized and there are well‐developed methods to control atomic composition, size, and functional groups. Accordingly, systematic studies have long been conducted to test how different types of pristine nanomaterials—as‐synthesized nanomaterials without additional surface functionalization—affect virus particles and have revealed a variety of antiviral mechanisms related to virus particle binding and steric blocking, chemical reactions involving nanomaterial‐induced reactive species, and virus particle disruption, as extensively covered in numerous reviews.[35] To date, however, most of these antiviral activities have been characterized in vitro, while it is more challenging to use pristine nanomaterials in vivo where they can show diminished antiviral activity. Key challenges include nonspecific binding of nanomaterials to other biological components and the protein corona that can form spontaneously on nanomaterial surfaces upon immersion in physiological environments.[36] In addition to conventional nanomaterial options, there has also been extensive interest in designing nanomaterials from poorly soluble antimicrobial compounds, which can improve solubility and potential usability in some cases. For example, Huang et al. reported the fabrication of water‐dispersible, benzoxazine monomer‐derived carbon dots with ≈4 nm diameter, which inhibited a wide range of viruses, including Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and Dengue (Figure 2a).[37] Significant reductions in viral infectivity in vitro against baby hamster kidney‐derived BHK‐21 and monkey kidney‐derived Vero cells were observed upon pretreatment of virus particles with the carbon dots (Figure 2b,c). Another study involved the fabrication of water‐dispersible, glycyrrhizic acid‐derived carbon dots that inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of nonhuman primate‐derived MARC‐145, Vero, and pig kidney‐derived PK‐15 cells by suppressing viral genome replication and stimulating innate immune responses.[38] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint –1 BZM‐CDs.

Taking inspiration from how a wide range of biological materials have spiky surfaces for increased adhesion, one of the most recent advances has been the development of spiky nanostructures that have improved contact with virus particles (Figure 2d). Based on the complex topology of spherical influenza virus particles, including the presence of protruding glycoproteins, Nie et al. fabricated spiky silica nanoparticles that exhibited improved adhesion to the virus particles, as compared to smooth silica nanoparticles (Figure 2e).[39] The spike dimensions were optimized so that the nanoparticle spikes could fit well in between the glycoprotein protrusions (Figure 2f,g). Notably, however, the spiky silica nanoparticles had low aqueous dispersibility, so they were initially coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) but did not inhibit influenza virus infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK‐II cells in vitro. Therefore, the spiky silica nanoparticles were coated with a red blood cell membrane extract, which facilitated antiviral activity in vitro, as indicated by reduced virus particle binding to cells and decreased viral infectivity. Cell membrane coatings are further discussed in Section 4.3 below and this example provides insight into how the biological functionality of nanomaterials can be modulated based on the surface coating. A combination of binding ligands and antiviral drugs was further conjugated on the spiky nanoparticle surface to enhance antiviral activity against influenza virus and inhibit infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro.[40] Porous gold nanoparticles with a high surface area have also been reported to inhibit infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK cells by a wide range of influenza virus strains in vitro.[41] Ultimately, such studies have provided insight into how nanoparticle composition and shape can influence antiviral activity and this research direction has been greatly enhanced in recent years by integrating nanomaterial design together with biomimetic surface functionalization with cell‐mimicking receptors and cell membrane extracts. 4.2 Receptor‐Functionalized Nanomaterials 4.2.1 Sulfonated Nanoparticles Virus particle attachment to cell membrane receptors is a critical first step in the infection process and, for many types of viruses, involves viral protein binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors that are present on cell surfaces.[42] As such, stopping these virus‐cell binding interactions via competitive inhibitors can prevent infection and various classes of sulfonated polysaccharides have been explored, including heparin[43] and heparin‐like molecules[44] along with metal complexes of sulfonated molecules, and exhibit antiviral activity in vitro.[45] Many of these antiviral molecules have been explored as topical microbicides to prevent vaginal transmission of viruses such as HIV, however, none have demonstrated efficacy in late‐stage clinical trials and intracorporeal efficacy is more challenging to achieve.[46] In light of these shortcomings and the potential utility of this biomimetic design concept in principle, there has been extensive interest in developing sulfonated nanoparticles with a well‐controlled, multivalent presentation of sulfonate groups to inhibit susceptible viruses. Baram‐Pinto et al. reported that sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection of Vero cells in vitro by preventing cell entry of virus particles and hence reducing cell‐to‐cell spreading as well.[47] Notably, the sulfonate groups in that study were attached to gold nanoparticles via short‐chain linkers with low conformational flexibility. Cagno et al. further investigated the design of sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles with short‐chain, low‐flexibility and long‐chain, high‐flexibility linkers and discovered that the use of more flexible chains enabled improved antiviral activity in vitro with Vero cells, ex vivo with human epivaginal tissue cultures, and in vivo in mice (Figure 3a).[48] While both types of sulfonate‐functionalized nanoparticles could bind to and inhibit viruses such as HSV‐2, only the nanoparticles with flexible linkers could inhibit viruses upon dilution due to stronger binding interactions and heparin was also inactive (Figure 3b–d). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that nanoparticle‐virus particle interactions in the latter case resulted in virus particle disruption, indicating a virucidal (“virus‐killing”) type of mechanism (Figure 3e–g). Intranasal administration of the sulfonated nanoparticles also prophylactically inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice in vivo.

Sulfonate‐functionalized inorganic nanoparticles as virucidal inhibitors to disrupt virus particles. a) Schematic illustration of nanoparticle strategies to inhibit virus particles that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on cellular surfaces during the infection process. The basic concept is to create biomimetic nanoparticles with sulfonate groups that can tightly bind to virus particles to prevent virus binding to HSPG cell receptors. Top row: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with low‐flexibility 3‐mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES), termed MES‐AuNPs, can bind relatively weakly to virus particles to prevent infection. However, the inhibitory effect of MES‐AuNPs is lost upon dilution and the virus particles remain infective. Bottom: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with high‐flexibility undecanesulfonic acid (MUS), termed MUS‐AuNPs, can bind relatively strongly to virus particles and prevent infection. The inhibitory effect of MUS‐AuNPs is maintained upon dilution and nullifies viral infectivity due to irreversible virus particle disruption.

Building on this work, Zacheo et al. recently explored how controlling the properties of the sulfonated ligands on the gold nanoparticle surface affects the degree of antiviral activity and identified glucose‐ and lactose‐based ligands with virucidal activity against Dengue virus to inhibit infection of Vero and human liver‐derived HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro.[49] Dey et al. have also reported the fabrication of ≈100–200 nm diameter, hydrogel‐like sulfonated nanogel particles and demonstrated that the nanogels can block HSV‐1 infection of monkey kidney‐derived Vero E6 cells in vitro.[50] Importantly, several types of nanogels were designed with different degrees of flexibility and more flexible nanogels showed greater antiviral activity. Cyclodextrin scaffolds functionalized with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids have also exhibited broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against numerous medically important viruses and further testing showed that HSV did not acquire resistance to the sulfonated cyclodextrin scaffolds.[51] The in vitro antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of money kidney‐derived Vero‐CCL81 and Vero E6 cells has been described in at least two recent works,[52] supporting that nanomaterial strategies involving sulfonate groups might be effective antiviral strategies to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 as well. 4.2.2 Sialylated Nanoparticles Different viruses bind to specific types of cell surface receptors as part of the infection process and another key example involves the influenza virus, which is a leading cause of respiratory viral infections.[53] Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins on the influenza virus particle surface bind to sialic acid‐containing glycan molecules that are prevalent on the surface of human lung cells as well as those of different animal species.[54] As with sulfonate‐related binding interactions and protein–glycan interactions in general, individual events of viral protein binding to sialic acids are relatively weak and strong interactions depend on multivalency.[55] Accordingly, a wide range of nanomaterial scaffolds with multiple sialic acid residues have been designed to competitively bind to influenza virus particles and thus prevent viral infection. Recent efforts have focused on how precisely tuning the distance between sialic acid residues on the scaffold affects HA binding. For example, Bandlow et al. investigated how rigid scaffolds composed of self‐assembled complexes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) enhanced binding interactions compared to more flexible, polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.[56] This finding agreed well with antiviral testing data on rigid and flexible core trivalent sialosides too.[57] Another important design variable has been considering linear versus branched scaffolds.[58] In one promising example, Kwon et al. reported the fabrication of a branched polyamidoamine scaffold that mirrored the inter‐spacing distance between HA proteins on influenza virus particles and intranasal administration of this scaffold was able to protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection.[59] Other recent examples include more sophisticated nanomaterial designs involving three‐way nucleic acid junctions[60] and star glycopolymers.[61] In addition to polymer‐like scaffolds, there has been ongoing exploration of sialic‐functionalized nanoparticles and a key example involves bacteriophage capsid nanoparticles with well‐controlled spacing of sialic acid‐functionalized ligands (Figure 4a,b).[62] Capsid nanoparticles with the correct Sia1 sialic acid ligands could specifically bind to influenza virus particles while nanoparticles functionalized with other glycan ligands did not bind to virus particles (Figure 4c,d). Likewise, only Sia1‐functionalized nanoparticles could inhibit influenza virus infection of MDCK‐II and human lung‐derived A549 cells in vitro in a dose‐dependent fashion and influenza virus pretreatment with the nanoparticles also protected mice from infection‐related weight loss in vivo (Figure 4e,f).

Richard et al. have also systematically investigated how sialic acid‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can be designed in terms of core nanoparticle size and linker length and unraveled how these parameters influence multivalent binding interactions, which can give rise to highly specific binding to particular ligand geometries.[63] In terms of soft‐matter nanoparticles, Bhatia et al. have also investigated the design of ≈250 nm diameter sialylated nanogel particles with varying degrees of flexibility and observed that highly flexible nanogel particles inhibited cell attachment of influenza virus by up to 400 times, as compared to more rigid nanogel particles.[64] The flexible nanogel particles also prevented influenza infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro down to picomolar concentrations. In another interesting example, Kong et al. reported the development of sialic acid‐functionalized lipid nanodisks that can bind to and cause perforation of influenza virus particles.[65] This example demonstrated that sialic acid‐functionalized nanoparticles can exhibit additional mechanistic functions beyond inhibiting virus‐cell interactions only and intravenous administration of the nanodisks also protected mice against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. In addition to new nanoparticle designs, there has been extensive recent progress in developing nanoscience measurement tools to quantify influenza viral protein‐sialic acid binding interactions. For example, single‐molecule force spectroscopy experiments have been conducted to comparatively measure the binding strength of influenza HA and neuraminidase proteins to sialic acid receptors[66] and the effects of multivalency on such interactions.[67] Di Iorio et al. have also fabricated sialic acid‐functionalized lipid bilayers and measured the binding of ≈22 nm diameter clusters of recombinant influenza HA proteins to supported lipid bilayers by quartz crystal microbalance‐dissipation (QCM‐D) experiments.[68] Other techniques such as microcavity arrays can also measure the diffusional motion of HA proteins bound to sialic acid‐functionalized supported lipid bilayers.[69] To date, most of these measurement strategies have been employed for understanding the fundamental role of multivalency in viral protein–glycan interactions while there remains tremendous potential to utilize these approaches for evaluating the functional performance of new nanomaterial inhibitors as well as to test drug inhibitor candidates that prevent such interactions.[70] 4.2.3 Additional Strategies In addition to glycan‐based decoy binding strategies for competitive inhibition, nucleic acid nanostructures have enabled creative design possibilities based on self‐assembling, complex topologies. For example, Kwon et al. reported the design of 3D DNA nanostructures with highly precise architectural features and incorporated Dengue viral protein‐binding aptamers within the nanostructure, which could bind multivalently to Dengue virus particles.[71] Different nanostructures such as heptagons, hexagons, and stars were tested and it was discovered that the star nanostructure yielded the most potent inhibitory activity to prevent Dengue virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to inhibit Dengue virus was around 2 × 10−9 m for star nanostructures, as compared to 10 × 10−9 and 440 × 10−9 m for the hexagon and heptagon nanostructures, respectively. This example provides an important demonstration of how synthetic receptors can be engineered in the future to develop more potent nanomaterial options, especially from natural, biocompatible materials, and with self‐assembling properties. These synthetic capabilities have also inspired current efforts to develop nanomaterial inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 based on understanding what receptor the virus binds and how to design receptor‐mimicking decoys. Specifically, the latest scientific evidence supports that SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the membrane‐associated angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell surfaces as part of the infection process.[72] Han et al. have reported the computational design of peptides that correspond to structurally important regions of ACE2 and can bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins to prevent infection.[73] It was suggested that the inhibitory peptides could be attached to nanoparticles with multivalent presentation, while such design strategies would require a careful consideration of how to best optimize the peptide attachment in terms of attachment chemistry, flexibility, density, and peptide conformation. There is also interest in engineering the ACE2 protein to bind more strongly to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins[74] and experimental work to test antiviral peptide inhibitors in this direction is ongoing. 4.3 Cell Membrane Decoys Over the past decade, there has been extensive and rapidly growing interest in coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane extracts to confer advantageous biological properties. For example, Hu et al. demonstrated that coating polymeric nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes can increase circulation time in mice.[75] It has also been demonstrated that cloaking polymeric nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of human platelets can improve immunocompatibility in terms of lower macrophage uptake and reduced complement activation, along with additional platelet‐like functionalities.[76] Ongoing progress in the field has also sparked interest in developing cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles that contain virus‐binding receptors and hence can bind to virus particles in order to prevent infection.[77] Numerous viruses such as Dengue and Zika are transmitted by mosquito vectors[78] and Rao et al. demonstrated that gelatin nanoparticles coated with mosquito cell membrane extracts can bind to Zika virus particles, whereby each ≈130 nm diameter nanoparticle binds to multiple virus particles.[79] This approach led to dose‐dependent reduction in viral infectivity of Vero cells in vitro and intravenous administration of the coated nanoparticles up to 2 days postinoculation also protected mice against virus‐induced mortality and body weight loss and reduced the level of viral infection in the brain. Red blood cell membrane‐coated magnetic nanoparticles with sialylated functional groups have also been employed to capture influenza virus particles.[80] In addition to using natural cell membrane extracts that contain typical amounts of virus‐binding receptors, there have been attempts to engineer cells to overexpress those receptors and to prepare cell‐derived membrane vesicles accordingly. For example, Liu et al. devised a biosynthetic strategy to overexpress the membrane receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is called human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), in HepG2 cells and prepared ≈200 nm diameter, cell membrane‐derived vesicles that were used to inhibit HBV infection of HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro and in mice with humanized livers in vivo (Figure 5a).[81] Compared to control membrane vesicles from the parent cell line with normal receptor quantities, the membrane vesicles from the engineered cell line with an overexpressed quantity of receptors exhibited appreciably greater antiviral activity levels and demonstrated improved treatment efficacy in the mouse model, as indicated by lower levels of HBV antibodies and nucleic acid copies (Figure 5b,c). Recently, Rao et al. reported the fabrication of cell membrane‐derived vesicles from human monocyte cells that were genetically engineered to express the ACE2 receptor and the ACE2‐functionalized vesicles could prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro.[82] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint [ 81 ] Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH. d) Strategy to capture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus particles by using cell‐membrane‐coated polymeric nanoparticles termed nanosponges (NS).

Similar approaches have also been taken to treat and prevent infection by HIV, which is known to infect T cells.[83] Polymeric nanoparticles were coated with the plasma membranes of CD4+ T cells, which contain the receptors needed for virus binding and cell entry, and the cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human‐monocyte‐derived macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, it was suggested that this cell membrane decoy strategy could be potentially advantageous to work against multiple, genetically diverse HIV strains because all strains bind to the same cell receptors.[85] A follow‐up study confirmed that the T cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit a wide range of HIV‐1 strains and surprisingly induced autophagy of HIV‐infected cells to suppress viral genome replication but had no effect on uninfected cells.[86] Recently, cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles have also been developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro (Figure 5d).[84] Nanoparticles coated with extracts from human lung epithelial type II or macrophage cells inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent fashion while nanoparticles coated with extracts from red blood cells were inactive (Figure 5e). These findings emphasize the importance of rationally designing biomimetic nanomaterial strategies based on a precise understanding of how a certain virus affects cells, and further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of these inhibitory capabilities in vivo.

5 Viral Membrane Inhibitors Most nanomaterial‐based antiviral strategies focus on targeting viral protein components in order to prevent virus‐cell binding interactions as described in the preceding examples. However, various types of viruses use distinct binding receptors to enter cells and such strategies are therefore intrinsically limited to working against a relatively narrow subset of viruses. On the other hand, many viral epidemics are caused by membrane‐enveloped viruses and a structurally intact viral membrane on enveloped viruses is necessary for viral infectivity, including virus‐cell fusion.[87] As such, a wide range of broad‐spectrum antiviral drug candidates have been explored to inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses based on targeting the viral membrane.[87] One of the most exciting groups of drug candidates within this class are membrane‐disruptive, antiviral peptides that inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses in order to abrogate viral infectivity.[88] Several antiviral peptides have been discovered that inhibit a wide range of membrane‐enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)[89] and HIV,[90] and include a 27‐mer amphipathic, α‐helical (AH) peptide that exhibits membrane‐curvature‐selective disruptive activity to inhibit small, membrane‐enveloped virus particles of ≈160 nm diameter or smaller.[91] In vitro antiviral testing experiments against various types of membrane‐enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have been conducted using a wide range of permissive, model cell lines such as Vero cells and human liver‐derived Huh 7.5 cells as well as primary cells such as mouse neuronal cells and human T cells. The results have demonstrated that some membrane‐active peptides exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses down to the nanomolar range along with low cell cytotoxicity.[92] While viral envelopes are derived from host cell membranes, the AH peptide and possibly other peptides can exhibit selective rupture of highly curved viral membranes due to membrane‐curvature‐triggered membrane disruption.[93] Indeed, mammalian cells are much larger than virus particles and hence possess an appreciably lower degree of membrane curvature and this curvature difference provides a distinguishing factor between viral and mammalian cell membranes.[94] These promising mechanistic features have motivated researchers to explore how to utilize viral‐membrane‐targeting, antiviral peptides in vivo, while exploring design strategies to overcome traditional challenges of peptide therapeutics, such as high susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and short circulation time.[95] To overcome these challenges, Jackman et al. explored the development of an engineered version of the AH peptide, composed of all D‐amino acids and termed AH‐D, which was able to therapeutically treat lethal Zika virus infection in a mouse model in vivo.[92] The basic design concept was called lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD) and posited that extracellular targeting of membrane‐enveloped viruses can reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in order to help curb viral infection (Figure 6a). Upon intravenous administration of the AH‐D peptide starting 3 days post‐virus inoculation, over 80% of mice survived Zika virus infection and exhibited markedly reduced clinical symptoms in general. Importantly, the AH‐D peptide was able to significantly reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in the blood as well as in multiple organs, including in the brain (Figure 6b). More extensive studies revealed that the AH‐D peptide is able to cross the intact blood‐brain barrier to treat Zika virus infection directly in the brain as well as to reduce infection‐related brain inflammation (Figure 6c,d).

From a material science perspective, another noteworthy point is that a large portion of the mechanistic understanding about how AH and AH‐D peptides work has been obtained from biosensing measurement strategies involving biomimetic, virus‐particle‐mimicking vesicles in combination with acoustic‐, optical‐, nanoplasmonic‐, and fluorescence‐microscopy‐based techniques.[91, 96] Examples include nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and plasmonic nanohole sensors[97] (Figure 6e–i). Such insights have led to further exploration of the AH‐D peptide as an antiviral drug candidate to prevent Zika virus infection of fetuses in pregnant mice[98] and forward‐looking discussion about how the LEAD concept could be useful for broadly treating mosquito‐borne virus infections, including not only Zika but also Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever among various possibilities.[99] This capability could be especially beneficial when a mosquito‐borne viral infection is clinically suspected but a differential diagnosis of the specific virus type is challenging.[100] The LEAD concept might be generally applicable to other types of membrane‐enveloped viruses as well since the viral membrane represents an Achilles heel and there is a high barrier to the emergence of drug‐resistant strains because the viral membrane is derived from host cell membranes and not encoded within the viral genome.[101] It has even been suggested that membrane‐enveloped SARS‐CoV‐2 might be susceptible to viral membrane disruption[102] and these aspects are particularly important because SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the brain has been linked to a wide range of COVID‐19 disease conditions.[103] While intravenously administered, antiviral peptides have demonstrated initial promise in some mouse models of viral infections, nanomaterial‐based drug delivery strategies could improve pharmacological activities and lead to improved targeting possibilities. Zhang et al. have reported the development of a cationic, membrane‐active antiviral peptide that was mixed together with anionic polymer chains to form ≈35 nm diameter nanoparticles.[104] These peptide‐polymer nanoparticles exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against HCV infection of Huh 7.5 cells and HIV infection of TZM‐bl cells, human lymphocytes, and monocyte‐derived macrophages, respectively, and also showed lower levels of hemolytic activity against red blood cells than the free peptide alone. Intramuscular injection of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles showed improved treatment of HIV‐1 infection in a mouse model in vivo, as compared to free peptide alone. In a follow‐up study, a refined version of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles was developed that was functionalized with galactosyl sugar molecules in order to enable improved HepG2 cell internalization in vitro and preferential liver accumulation in mice in vivo.[105] Ongoing work can further expand the potential of targeting membrane‐enveloped viruses by using antiviral peptides and other classes of small‐molecule inhibitors[106] that impair viral membrane‐associated proteins to prevent virus‐cell fusion in combination with nanomaterial strategies to enhance targeted delivery prospects. In addition to directly targeting virus particles, it might be possible to also disrupt membrane‐enveloped exosomes that carry viral components such as nucleic acids and proteins and can be involved in viral infection and transmission processes.[107]

6 Virus‐Removing Blood Filters Another approach to effectively remove circulating virus particles from the blood of infected hosts has relied on the use of extracorporeal blood‐filtering devices and advances upon medical device technology that was originally used to treat sepsis infections.[108] Early work by Kang et al. demonstrated that a microfluidic device can effectively remove a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood.[109] To achieve this objective, ≈130 nm diameter magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) protein molecules, which can bind to sugar molecules found on the surface of various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses along with endotoxins.[110] The MBL‐functionalized nanoparticles were mixed together with circulating blood, could bind to circulating pathogens, and then the nanoparticle‐pathogen mixtures could be magnetically separated before the blood was returned to the host. In rat models of bacterial infection, more than 90% of bacteria were reduced along with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Seiler et al. have further explored the use of an engineered version of MBL that demonstrated improved pathogen capture in blood and urine samples.[111] Based on these findings, there has been ongoing progress to develop extracorporeal blood filters for virus particle removal applications as well. Tullis et al. demonstrated that hemodialysis treatment using a hollow‐fiber cartridge that contained antibody‐functionalized agarose beads could effectively remove HIV‐1 virus particles and viral proteins from cell culture media and blood.[112] These capabilities have led to the exploration of clinical‐stage medical device technology to broadly capture a wide range of circulating virus particles by replacing the antibody functionalization with MBL functionalization. Early reports indicated preliminary testing success to capture HIV and HCV virus particles along with binding to Dengue, influenza, Ebola, and Marburg viral proteins.[113] A pilot human clinical trial using a full‐scale version of this medical device technology was used to remove HCV from the blood of 4 HCV‐positive patients and resulted in an average drop in HCV viral loads of around 57%.[114] Follow‐up studies showed HCV viral load reductions in additional patients and it was further suggested that continuous application of this treatment approach could potentially reduce HCV to clinically undetectable levels within a few days, especially if used in combination with conventional antiviral drug therapies.[115] Büttner et al. have also reported that the medical device technology has been used to treat one patient with Ebola virus infection[116] and recent works have explored how these extracorporeal blood filters might be useful to remove coronaviruses and Marburg virus from infected blood.[117] With respect to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it has also been noted that virus‐removing blood filters could be a useful technology.[118] Given the small number of patients in the aforementioned clinical testing, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present stage, however, there are bright prospects to continue exploring virus‐removing blood filter technology. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the initiation of a feasibility study, with up to 40 human patients, to test the treatment efficacy of an extracorporeal blood filter based on this medical device technology for patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis and severe COVID‐19 disease.[119] In terms of future innovation in this direction, it is important to continue exploring how to develop improved filtration devices while also creating new biofunctionalization strategies to improve virus‐binding capacity and perhaps apply peptide functionalization schemes to catalytically damage virus particles as opposed to intact virus particle binding alone. Looking forward, these medical device technologies can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antiviral drug therapies to lower the amount of infectious virus particles in blood while also inhibiting the production of new virus particles among other possibilities.

7 Virus‐Mimicking Nanoparticle Vaccines 7.1 Design Rationale There has also been tremendous progress in developing nanoparticle‐based vaccine strategies to prevent and treat viral infections. In general, viral infections provoke the immune system, which can recognize viral proteins on the virus particle surface (“antigens”) and produce antibodies that bind to these antigens to neutralize virus particles.[120] In some cases, natural antibodies produced in response to a viral infection can have extremely high specificity and potency to inhibit virus particles.[121] For these reasons, the blood plasma from patients who recover from a certain type of virus infection is often given as a medical treatment to infected patients afflicted with the same type of virus infection.[122] In such cases, the plasma can contain high levels of neutralizing antibodies that bind to and inhibit virus particles.[123] However, the specific types and concentrations of antibodies present in blood plasma vary from person‐to‐person, potentially limiting reliable clinical use.[124] Hence, there has been extensive interest in recombinantly manufacturing specific, highly potent neutralizing antibodies as an alternative treatment option.[125] This latter approach allows more precise control over antibody composition and dosing. Recombinant antibody therapies also reduce the risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, which can arise in some cases from non‐neutralizing antibodies that are also present in plasma.[125, 126] The same logic applies to vaccine development where the key objective is to administer a virus‐mimicking immunogenic material so that a strong and focused immune response can be trained. The target objective is to generate high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies while minimizing production of non‐neutralizing antibodies that can otherwise inadvertently promote virus infection in some cases. Over the past few years, virus‐mimicking nanomaterial design strategies have been at the forefront of creating next‐generation vaccine strategies now reaching human clinical trials. The combination of nanomaterials, biomimetics, and protein engineering has led to unprecedented capabilities to rationally finetune immune responses and elicit high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies in a safe and effective manner. These capabilities are currently being extended to develop a nanoparticle vaccine candidate to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Recent progress in the field highlights the merits of both natural and engineered protein scaffolds to create self‐assembling, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines with excellent biomechanical and immunological properties. The fast‐moving progress on this subject is reviewed in this section along with coverage of other vaccine nanoparticle strategies. 7.2 Types of Nanoparticle Vaccines There is broad interest in integrating material science and protein engineering strategies to develop safe, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines that present viral protein antigens in a highly organized and symmetrical manner in order to induce strong immune responses.[127] Compared to free antigens, nanoparticle vaccines have several compelling advantages, including greater antigen stability, multivalent presentation of antigens, and targeted delivery.[128] As such, nanoparticle vaccines can bind multivalently to multiple receptors on B cells, which are immune cells involved in antibody production, resulting in more robust immune responses and high levels of immune protection.[24] A wide variety of nanoparticle types are being explored to prevent infectious diseases in general, including self‐assembling protein nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomal nanoparticles, and polymer scaffolds.[129] Key design considerations include optimizing the antigen structure (more precisely, the immunogen structure) to elicit the desired immune response, tuning vaccine delivery, and inducing focused immune responses.[130] From a biomimetic perspective, one of the most promising recent design advances has involved self‐assembled nanoparticle vaccines as discussed below along with introducing other nanoparticle vaccine design strategies. 7.2.1 Natural Protein Scaffolds The earliest example of a natural protein scaffold to form a nanoparticle vaccine involved the use of ferritin, which self‐assembles into nearly spherical, hollow nanoparticles that have ≈12 nm core diameter and are composed of 24 protein molecules with symmetrical organization.[131] By overcoming several challenges related to protein glycosylation and oligomerization, Kanekiyo et al. first reported the design of a ferritin‐based, influenza nanoparticle vaccine in 2013 that presented eight trimers of influenza HA viral protein on the nanoparticle surface in a native‐like configuration that enabled a superior immune response to conventionally used influenza vaccine strategies based on inactivated virus particles.[132] From a material science perspective, the key innovation was controlling the location at which ferritin and HA were genetically fused together in order to recombinantly express ferritin‐HA fusion proteins that self‐assembled into nanoparticles with repetitively spaced, trimeric HA spikes (Figure 7a,b). Ferritin‐HA nanoparticle immunization induced a strong immune response, as indicated by high levels of neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza H1N1 strains and protection against influenza virus infection in a ferret model (Figure 7c,d). Recently, Kelly et al. have elucidated how ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccination in mice triggers principally germinal center expansion and maturation of memory B cells, which are involved in antibody production.[133] In another study, Yassine et al. further explored the development of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines that presented a truncated version of HA, which corresponded to the stem region that is conserved across different HA subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and hence its trimeric presentation on the nanoparticle surface conferred protection against a wider range of influenza subtypes in mouse and ferret models.[134] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ).

Ferritin nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed to prevent infections from viruses such as HIV‐1 and Sliepen et al. first reported the design of ferritin nanoparticles presenting HIV‐1 envelope (Env) protein trimers, which demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity in mice and rabbits.[136] Neutralizing antibodies were generated to inhibit some but not all HIV‐1 strains, and it was particularly challenging to inhibit certain strains classified as “difficult‐to‐neutralize”.[137] It was discussed how the nanoparticle design might be improved by reducing steric hindrance between adjacent Env trimers. He et al. refined the structure‐based design of the trimeric Env antigens presented on the ferritin nanoparticle surface along with optimizing spacing between the trimers in order to yield more robust B cell responses.[138] More detailed engineering of the Env antigen structure increased Env trimer recognition on the ferritin nanoparticles by a broader range of naïve B cells, resulting in elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.[139] Due to the high sequence variation among Env proteins across different HIV‐1 strains, Sliepen et al. have designed a new Env antigen structure based on a consequence sequence incorporating the epitopes of many broadly neutralizing antibodies, and presented the Env antigen trimers on ferritin nanoparticles to yield strong neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits and macaques.[140] In addition, He et al. have reported additional protein engineering efforts to improve the stability of wild‐type Env antigens by switching out the ectodomain with a more stable version from an engineered Env antigen, which enabled improved generation of neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit difficult‐to‐neutralize HIV‐1 strains, in mice and rabbits.[141] Together, the ongoing work with ferritin‐Env nanoparticle vaccines to prevent HIV‐1 infection demonstrates the superior immune responses generated by antigen trimers on the nanoparticle surface, while highlighting the potential to combine these nanomaterial efforts with antigen‐based protein engineering efforts. Such possibilities have also been explored for a wide range of other viruses and support the broad versatility of ferritin nanoparticle technology for developing next‐generation vaccines. Kanekiyo et al. have designed a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) infection by conjugating ferritin molecules to a truncated domain from the EBV gp350 protein that contains the receptor‐binding site needed for B cell infection.[142] On the ferritin nanoparticle surface, the antigen formed dimers, which is a distinct conformation to the trimeric presentation cases discussed above. Importantly, compared to the soluble gp350 antigen, the nanoparticle vaccine still elicited markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies by 10‐ to 100‐fold in mice and nonhuman primates and also conferred protective immunity on mice in a lethal virus challenge model. Bu et al. have also developed another form of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent EBV infection based on a different antigen (gH), which alone and in complexation with gL and gp42 proteins helps to generate neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus‐cell fusion and works against multiple cell types instead of only preventing B cell infection.[143] In another important example, Wang et al. have reported a dual‐targeting, ferritin nanoparticle vaccine strategy to prevent and treat chronic HBV infection in mice based on activating two types of immune cells to induce high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibodies.[144] Recent work has further demonstrated that ferritin nanoparticles are an excellent platform to present viral antigens for developing HCV vaccines that might work against a wide range of HCV genotypes[145] and also to develop vaccines for treating RSV infection.[146] Notably, in the latter case, a glycosylated version of the RSV antigen was designed that induced a higher ratio of neutralizing antibodies to non‐neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates, which could be significant because higher levels of non‐neutralizing antibodies are thought to be associated with antibody‐mediated disease enhancement.[146] In addition to fabricating ferritin nanoparticles composed of one type of building block component, there has been interest in developing two‐component ferritin nanoparticles in order to present oligomers of multiple antigens on the nanoparticle surface. For example, Georgiev et al. reported the development of ferritin nanoparticles composed of two types of ferritin constructs, one of which was fused to an influenza virus antigen and the other one of which was fused to an HIV‐1 antigen, and nanoparticle self‐assembly resulted in trimeric presentation of both antigens.[147] Importantly, vaccination with this nanoparticle strategy in guinea pigs could induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibited both viruses. Since there are many different subtypes of influenza virus, Kanekiyo et al. expanded on this nanoparticle design strategy to design and coassemble ferritin‐HA constructs encoding HA with one of two receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) and the resulting nanoparticles had mosaic HA trimers that presented a mixture of RBDs to yield a broader antibody response than nanoparticles with either RBD alone.[148] Vaccination in mice led to the discovery of a neutralizing antibody that works against a wide range of influenza virus strains. Accordingly, nanoparticle‐based strategies presenting multiple antigens have been suggested as one possible route to create a universal influenza vaccine.[25] While ferritin nanoparticles have proven useful for creating vaccine nanoparticle technology, there has been extensive interest in identifying other natural protein scaffolds that can self‐assemble into nanoparticles with different sizes. Also in 2013, Jardine et al. reported the development of ≈32 nm diameter, self‐assembling nanoparticles composed of 60 recombinantly expressed lumazine synthase (LS) protein molecules from Aquifex aeolicus, which exhibit symmetrical organization, and designed an LS fusion protein together with HIV‐1 Env antigen that could form nanoparticles with enhanced B cell activation and lymph node trafficking properties.[149] In follow‐up work, an improved version of the LS nanoparticle vaccine platform was designed and induced promising immune responses in different mouse models in vivo, toward the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV‐1 infection.[150] Havenar‐Daughton et al. further investigated single‐dose immunization of rhesus monkeys with this HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccine and noted that subcutaneous immunization yielded markedly larger B cell responses and lymph node drainage than intramuscular drainage.[151] Tokatlian et al. have also explored how antigen glycosylation of LS‐ and ferritin‐based HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines is an important factor in modulating antibody responses (Figure 7e,f).[135] The results demonstrated that antigen glycosylation is an important factor in eliciting high levels of antigen‐specific antibody levels and appreciably lower levels were observed with deglycosylated antigen (Figure 7g). Additionally, Krebs et al. have investigated ≈23 nm diameter nanoparticle self‐assembly from the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in order to create nanoparticle vaccines presenting an HIV‐1 Env antigen fragment, which yielded an antigen‐specific antibody in immunized rabbits although multiple rounds of immunization were needed to elicit moderately protective, neutralizing antibody levels in a large fraction of rabbits.[152] As seen in these examples, it is important to point out that self‐assembled nanoparticles from different natural protein scaffolds have distinct functionalities, as noted by how protein scaffolds fused together with full‐length viral protein antigens can only self‐assemble into nanoparticles for some, but not all, of the scaffold options and antigen spacing is another important factor affecting both nanoparticle self‐assembly and immunogenicity.[138] In part, such design issues have motivated the use of full‐length viral proteins or truncated versions thereof and the type of nanoparticle structure can also affect antigen oligomerization in some cases.[142] Another important point concerns the nanoparticle vaccine fabrication strategy. To date, the structural components of virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines have been recombinantly expressed in host cells in vitro and, upon expression, spontaneously self‐assemble into antigen‐presenting nanoparticles. In such cases, the nanoparticle vaccine suspension is then injected into animals as part of the immunization process. As an alternative strategy, recent work has also investigated nucleic‐acid‐based vaccination strategies that could enable the in vivo expression of nanoparticle structural components and, in some cases, in vivo self‐assembly of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. Melo et al. reported the development of a lipid‐nanoparticle‐encapsulated alphavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) replicon encoding the HIV Env antigen fused with LS.[153] A single injection of this lipid nanoparticle suspension encoding the HIV Env antigen yielded high levels of Env‐specific antibodies and also led to improved B cell responses compared to recombinant protein immunization. In another demonstration, Xu et al. reported the use of a DNA vaccine plasmid to induce the in vivo expression of a nanoparticle structural component comprising an HIV Env antigen fused with LS, and demonstrated its in vivo structural assembly in mice based on functional studies along with improved immune responses in mice and guinea pigs compared to immunization with a similar delivery strategy encoding antigen monomers only.[154] The design concept was further generalized to other natural protein scaffolds, such as ferritin nanoparticles, which also induced high immune responses and the delivery strategy could also be adapted to influenza HA antigen in order to endow mice with protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge. From a translational perspective, there has been tremendous progress in developing ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccines for preventing influenza infections based on ongoing human clinical trials being conducted in the United States. Preliminary data from the first‐in‐human trial (NCT03186781) of a ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccine provided initial evidence that the vaccine is safe and well‐tolerated in humans while another human clinical trial (NCT03814720) is ongoing to evaluate the dosing, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ferritin‐HA‐stem nanoparticles as a potential universal flu vaccine candidate. 7.2.2 Engineered Protein Scaffolds The insights gained from nanoparticle vaccines based on self‐assembling natural protein scaffolds have highlighted the importance of tuning antigen structure, conformation, density, and spacing on the nanoparticle surface. While several types of self‐assembling proteins exist in nature, the number of options is intrinsically limited, which has prompted researchers to further explore the design of nanoparticle vaccines from self‐assembling, engineered protein scaffolds that enable greater control over nanomaterial properties. Toward this goal, King et al. reported computational strategies to design 24‐subunit protein nanomaterials composed of two types of self‐assembling protein subunit components, and experimentally demonstrated that it was possible to rationally tune the nanomaterial structure, shape, and symmetry in alignment with the computational designs.[155] In another study, Bale et al. applied similar approaches to design larger, two‐component protein nanomaterials composed of 120 subunits with icosahedral symmetry and had 24–40 nm diameters that are similar to the size of small viral capsids.[156] Another advantage of using two‐component engineered proteins is greater control over the fabrication process. Natural protein scaffolds self‐assemble upon recombinant expression while engineered protein components can be expressed independently and then mixed as desired to self‐assemble into nanoparticles in vitro. Marcandalli et al. reported the first example of an engineered‐protein‐based nanoparticle vaccine that was built from two self‐assembling components and presented multiple copies of a trimeric RSV envelope antigen termed DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8a,b).[157] One protein component was designed to present DS‐Cav1 and spontaneously formed trimers by itself, while the other protein component formed pentamers by itself. The two protein components were expressed independently and, when mixed together in vitro, 20 trimers of the first protein component and 12 pentamers of the second protein component self‐assembled to form two‐component nanoparticles with ≈55 nm diameter inclusive of the antigen trimer spikes. Unlike previous nanoparticle vaccine designs, it was possible to control the density of DS‐Cav1 antigen trimer on the nanoparticle surface based on mixing different amounts of the first protein component with a genetically fused version of the first protein component that presents DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8c). Importantly, the nanoparticle presentation of DS‐Cav1 trimers not only improved antigen physical stability but also nanoparticle vaccine immunization in mice and nonhuman primates led to nearly 10‐fold higher neutralizing antibody titers along with a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response than immunization with soluble DS‐Cav1 trimers (Figure 8d). Brouwer et al. have also used a similar two‐component nanoparticle strategy to present HIV‐1 envelope antigen trimers.[158] In this case, the two‐component nanoparticle induced particularly high antibody responses after a single round of immunization, as compared to the same antigen trimers in soluble form and displayed on single‐component ferritin nanoparticles. There is ongoing exploration of different nanoparticle shape designs[159] and how nanoparticle formulations can improve lymph node targeting in nonhuman primate models.[160] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ) and the bar indicates the geometric mean, which is listed for each test group.

In terms of COVID‐19 vaccine development, Walls et al. recently reported the development of a two‐component nanoparticle vaccine candidate that displays the RBD of a SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope protein antigen (Figure 8e).[161] From a nanomaterial design perspective, a key innovation was introducing a genetically encoded flexible linker to connect the smaller RBD domain with the main nanoparticle structure. It is also noteworthy that the basic self‐assembling nanoparticle design involved the same two protein components as in the RSV and HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines described above, demonstrating the modular nature of nanoparticle vaccines and the ability to rationally swap antigens to support rapid vaccine development (Figure 8f). Importantly, the COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine induced nearly ten‐fold greater neutralizing antibody titers in mice than a soluble antigen trimer even when the nanoparticles were administered at a five‐time lower dose (Figure 8g). The nanoparticle vaccine also induced a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response, as compared to human convalescent sera. This immune response resulted in complete protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an in vivo virus challenge mouse model (Figure 8h). The combination of these features has further spurred ongoing manufacturing efforts to create a COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine in abundant quantities for potential human clinical trials. Looking forward, Ueda et al. have also continued designing new nanoparticle vaccine designs that are tailored for different types of viral protein domains[157] and there is excellent potential to continue exploring protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. As control over the molecular‐level biomimetic features of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines continues to improve, there will be growing emphasis on production scalability and how these nanoparticle vaccines can compete with other vaccine candidates in terms of practical factors such as cost, storage, and scalability. 7.2.3 Additional Scaffold Options While there has been tremendous progress in developing protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines to prevent viral infections, liposome‐ and inorganic nanoparticle‐based strategies have also proven advantageous and demonstrate important nanomaterial desiBiomimetic Nanomaterial Strategies for Virus Targeting: Antiviral Therapies and VaccinesBiomimetic nanomaterials have excellent potential to combat viral infections and lay the groundwork for next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

Since virus particles are nanoscale entities, nanomaterial design strategies are ideally suited to create advanced materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles. In this progress report, the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials are critically discussed for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Particular focus is placed on nanomaterial design concepts and material innovations that can be readily developed to thwart future viral threats. Pertinent nanomaterial examples from the COVID‐19 situation are also covered along with discussion of human clinical trial efforts underway that might lead to next‐generation antiviral therapies and vaccines.

1 Introduction Over the past decade, there have been growing calls to recognize that emerging infectious diseases represent a major threat to global health and that we must be better prepared to deal with a future viral pandemic, which could arise from an unknown or understudied virus.[1] In 2018, the World Health Organization expanded on these viewpoints by preparing a list of viral and nonviral pathogens that could cause Disease X, a future human disease outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential that would be triggered by a newly emerged pathogen.[2] In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic arose as the first Disease X and was caused by the global spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has infected over 39 million people and caused over 1 100 000 deaths to date.[3] COVID‐19 is considered by some experts to be a once‐in‐a‐century pandemic[4] and has highlighted how viral pandemics can create a perfect storm of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that is disrupting the institutions of daily life worldwide, including work, healthcare, education, and transportation.[5] Our understanding of COVID‐19 continues to grow since a local outbreak of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and led to the discovery of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is related to other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).[6] SARS‐CoV‐2 is believed to be a zoonotic virus that crossed over from bats[7] and acquired mutations via natural selection that caused the virus to more efficiently infect human cells and transmit among humans.[8] Early reports of human respiratory disease[9] have since been followed up by numerous, ongoing studies to gain further insight into COVID‐19 disease pathogenesis, including how severe cases of COVID‐19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome.[10] Various organs are affected by the disease, including lungs,[11] heart,[12] liver,[13] kidney,[14] and brain.[15] As such, there has been tremendous attention placed on the treatment and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and growing attention to the role that materials science can play in stopping COVID‐19 and, more broadly, the wide range of viral infections affecting global society along with future viral threats.[16] The objective of this progress report is to cover the latest advances in biomimetic nanomaterials for combating viral infections, including in the areas of nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors, biomimetic virus particle capture schemes, and nanoparticle vaccines. Major emphasis is placed on covering the most recent developments mainly within the past three years, while distilling key nanomaterial design principles that can lead to next‐generation advanced materials for the treatment and prevention of viral infections. Where applicable, we also discuss how these nanomaterial strategies are being explored to stop SARS‐CoV‐2 along with coverage of relevant human clinical trial efforts.

2 Advanced Materials for Virus Targeting Virus particles (“virions”) are biological nanoparticles that contain viral genetic material and are surrounded by a protein or lipid bilayer membrane coating. The particles are typically around 50–300 nm in diameter and are functionalized with glycoproteins that play an important role in binding to cells.[17] There are two main types: enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Membrane‐enveloped viruses are surrounded by a host‐cell‐derived lipid membrane that contains embedded glycoproteins while nonenveloped viruses have a protein‐based capsid shell without lipid membrane.[18] In both cases, the glycoproteins on the virus particle surface are the major antigens, which are recognized by the host immune system and can elicit an antibody response.[19] Once the immune system is trained to recognize a viral antigen, the immune system can rapidly produce antibodies that bind to the virus particles and prevent them from causing infection.[20] Fundamentally, virus particles are parasites that must infect susceptible cells and highjack cellular machinery in order to produce new virus particles.[21] The basic steps are presented in Scheme 1a. The first step involves virus particle binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane surface, which can result in cellular entry and start of the infection process. Each type of cell has a characteristic pattern of receptors found on the cellular surface and different viruses bind preferentially to particular ones. For example, many viruses bind specifically to glycan‐functionalized receptors containing sulfonate or sialyl functional groups. Infected cells produce new copies of viral genetic material and viral proteins, which are then assembled in order to produce new virus particles that are released extracellularly and infect new cells. The process continues indefinitely until an organism succumbs to virus‐induced cellular damage and related immune responses, and viruses can also spread between organisms via a wide range of transmission mechanisms. Scheme 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Biomimetic nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. a) Overview of virus life cycle. Viruses cannot replicate independently and must infect cells. The replication machinery of infected cells is highjacked by viruses and used to create new copies of the viral genome and proteins, which are then assembled into new virus particles that are released from the cell and spread to infect other cells. b) Examples of different nanomaterial strategies for virus targeting. i) Nanomaterial‐enhanced viral replication inhibitors can inhibit the production of new virus particles. ii) Virus‐binding nanoparticles and iii) cell membrane decoys can bind to virus particles and prevent viral infection of cells. iv) Viral membrane inhibitors can disrupt membrane‐enveloped virus particles, abrogating infectivity. v) Extracorporeal blood filters can remove circulating virus particles from the bloodstream to reduce disease burden. vi) Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines that mimic the multivalent presentation of antigens on virus particle surfaces can elicit improved immune responses that lead to greater protection against future virus exposure. Depending on the objective, various nanomaterial strategies can be useful to stop viruses, as presented in Scheme 1b. Conventionally, antiviral drugs have been developed to inhibit viral genome replication inside infected cells, thereby preventing the production of new virus particles.[22] Nanomaterial strategies have proven useful to enhance the pharmacological properties of viral genome replication inhibitors, including circulation time. While it is advantageous to stop viral genome replication in order to help treat existing viral infections, there is also extensive interest in exploring how nanomaterials can be useful to prevent viral infections.[23] Virus‐binding nanomaterials can attach to virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells. Pristine nanomaterials can be used along with receptor‐functionalized ones and cell‐membrane‐decoy nanomaterials, which are coated with cell membrane extracts containing natural receptors. Ongoing efforts have also devised nanomaterial‐based strategies to effectively remove extracellular virus particles from infected organisms by either selectively disrupting virus particles or by removing them through extracorporeal filtration strategies. Moreover, some of the most recent and innovative advances have come from developing nanoparticle vaccines, especially self‐assembling protein‐based ones, which have demonstrated excellent potential to prevent multiple types of viral infections.[24] One of the most promising candidates has been rapidly advanced into human clinical trials as a potential universal flu vaccine[25] and similar strategies are now being applied to SARS‐CoV‐2. A key innovative aspect of these nanoparticle vaccines is that critical architectural properties of virus particles, particularly the specific organization of glycoprotein antigens, can now be mimicked with nanoscale precision and these advanced material capabilities have led to nanoparticle vaccine candidates with superior immunizing capabilities to currently used vaccine strategies in some cases. The latest progress in all of these areas is covered in the following sections.

3 Viral Replication Inhibitors The most widely used class of direct‐acting antiviral drugs encompasses small molecules that inhibit the genome replication of viruses inside infected cells.[26] These replication processes involve a multiprotein replication complex called the viral replicase[27] and antiviral therapy often targets one or more types of the viral proteins that form this complex. Key examples of antiviral drugs in this class include nucleoside and nucleotide analogues that inhibit the viral polymerase, which is the main enzyme involved in viral genome production.[28] Over the years, there have been extensive efforts to develop prodrugs[29]—inactive molecules that are metabolized into the active drug in vivo—and drug delivery systems that enable longer circulation time, targeted delivery, and/or improved safety of viral replication inhibitors, in line with broader innovation trends in the nanomedicine field as a whole. Promising examples include development of a once weekly, orally administered antiviral drug delivery platform that consists of several polymer matrices with different drug release profiles in order to consistently maintain pharmaceutically relevant concentrations of antiviral drugs in systemic circulation.[30] One of the most recent examples of cutting‐edge nanomaterial strategies to deliver viral replication inhibitors involves the class of macromolecular prodrugs, comprising polymer‐functionalized antiviral drugs in complexation with serum proteins. Andersen et al. described the formation of polymer–protein–drug complexes that enable long‐duration therapy with multiple antiviral drugs.[31] A polymer–protein complex comprised of a single, ≈7 kDa N‐(2‐hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (PHPMA) chain per covalently attached albumin molecule was designed and exhibited much longer circulation half‐time and higher concentrations in mice upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as compared to free PHPMA alone. Marked accumulation of the polymer–protein complex in mouse lymph nodes was also reported. Two antiviral drugs, azidothymidine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), were covalently incorporated into the monomer backbone via a labile disulfide linkage for eventual intracellular release of free drug molecules. These functionalized building blocks were assembled into a colloidal‐like polymer–protein–drug complex consisting of one polymer chain with six AZT and four 3TC copies along with one albumin molecule and inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human T cells in vitro. Frich et al. expanded on this macromolecular prodrug strategy by devising a “hitchhiking” scheme in which a polymer–drug conjugate was fabricated and exhibited noncovalent binding to serum albumin proteins, as indicated by biophysical experiments and increased circulation half‐time in mice in vivo.[32] The key innovation was functionalizing the PHPMA component with 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) lipid, which is a binding ligand for serum albumin proteins found in circulation (Figure 1a). A polymer–drug conjugate was synthesized consisting of DSPE–PHPMA and multiple copies of acyclovir (ACV), which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpes simplex virus (HSV). It was verified that free ACV could be released from the DSPE–PHPMA–ACV complex upon incubation in physiologically relevant conditions containing glutathione (GSH). It was determined that >100 × 10−9 m ACV was released within 3 h from 1 g L–1 PHPMA–ACV in GSH‐containing phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) while nearly negligible release was observed over an appreciably longer time period of 24 h in PBS without GSH. Importantly, DSPE–PHPMA–ACV also exhibited antiviral activity against HSV type 2 (HSV‐2) infection of baby hamster kidney‐derived ELVIS and human cervix‐derived HeLa cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous administration of the polymer–drug complex helped to suppress vaginal HSV‐2 infection in an in vivo mouse model based on viral infectivity measurements of vaginal wash and spinal cord specimens (Figure 1b).

For example, Krüger et al. demonstrated that idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to treat HSV infection, could be converted into a phosphoramidite derivative and then these building blocks were used to synthesize linear nucleic acid scaffolds with 7 or 14 attached drug molecules (Figure 1c).[33] In vitro release experiments revealed that the scaffolds are stable in serum‐free cell culture medium while free idoxuridine was gradually released within 2–6 h in the presence of serum, indicating the potential utility of these scaffolds for in vivo applications (Figure 1d). Future work needs to continue exploring the prophylactic and therapeutic utility of macromolecular prodrugs of viral replication inhibitors in animal models, while there exist numerous potential advantages in terms of well‐defined colloidal properties and targeted codelivery of two or more antiviral drugs to increase the barrier for drug‐resistant virus strains to emerge.[34] There also remains an outstanding need to investigate the mechanisms of drug release in vivo and to also continue exploring how macromolecular prodrugs can be engineered to target specific organs.

4 Virus Particle Binding Inhibitors 4.1 Pristine Nanomaterials Over the years, various classes of nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles and carbon‐based nanomaterials have been synthesized and there are well‐developed methods to control atomic composition, size, and functional groups. Accordingly, systematic studies have long been conducted to test how different types of pristine nanomaterials—as‐synthesized nanomaterials without additional surface functionalization—affect virus particles and have revealed a variety of antiviral mechanisms related to virus particle binding and steric blocking, chemical reactions involving nanomaterial‐induced reactive species, and virus particle disruption, as extensively covered in numerous reviews.[35] To date, however, most of these antiviral activities have been characterized in vitro, while it is more challenging to use pristine nanomaterials in vivo where they can show diminished antiviral activity. Key challenges include nonspecific binding of nanomaterials to other biological components and the protein corona that can form spontaneously on nanomaterial surfaces upon immersion in physiological environments.[36] In addition to conventional nanomaterial options, there has also been extensive interest in designing nanomaterials from poorly soluble antimicrobial compounds, which can improve solubility and potential usability in some cases. For example, Huang et al. reported the fabrication of water‐dispersible, benzoxazine monomer‐derived carbon dots with ≈4 nm diameter, which inhibited a wide range of viruses, including Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and Dengue (Figure 2a).[37] Significant reductions in viral infectivity in vitro against baby hamster kidney‐derived BHK‐21 and monkey kidney‐derived Vero cells were observed upon pretreatment of virus particles with the carbon dots (Figure 2b,c). Another study involved the fabrication of water‐dispersible, glycyrrhizic acid‐derived carbon dots that inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of nonhuman primate‐derived MARC‐145, Vero, and pig kidney‐derived PK‐15 cells by suppressing viral genome replication and stimulating innate immune responses.[38] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint –1 BZM‐CDs.

Taking inspiration from how a wide range of biological materials have spiky surfaces for increased adhesion, one of the most recent advances has been the development of spiky nanostructures that have improved contact with virus particles (Figure 2d). Based on the complex topology of spherical influenza virus particles, including the presence of protruding glycoproteins, Nie et al. fabricated spiky silica nanoparticles that exhibited improved adhesion to the virus particles, as compared to smooth silica nanoparticles (Figure 2e).[39] The spike dimensions were optimized so that the nanoparticle spikes could fit well in between the glycoprotein protrusions (Figure 2f,g). Notably, however, the spiky silica nanoparticles had low aqueous dispersibility, so they were initially coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) but did not inhibit influenza virus infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK‐II cells in vitro. Therefore, the spiky silica nanoparticles were coated with a red blood cell membrane extract, which facilitated antiviral activity in vitro, as indicated by reduced virus particle binding to cells and decreased viral infectivity. Cell membrane coatings are further discussed in Section 4.3 below and this example provides insight into how the biological functionality of nanomaterials can be modulated based on the surface coating. A combination of binding ligands and antiviral drugs was further conjugated on the spiky nanoparticle surface to enhance antiviral activity against influenza virus and inhibit infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro.[40] Porous gold nanoparticles with a high surface area have also been reported to inhibit infection of canine kidney‐derived MDCK cells by a wide range of influenza virus strains in vitro.[41] Ultimately, such studies have provided insight into how nanoparticle composition and shape can influence antiviral activity and this research direction has been greatly enhanced in recent years by integrating nanomaterial design together with biomimetic surface functionalization with cell‐mimicking receptors and cell membrane extracts. 4.2 Receptor‐Functionalized Nanomaterials 4.2.1 Sulfonated Nanoparticles Virus particle attachment to cell membrane receptors is a critical first step in the infection process and, for many types of viruses, involves viral protein binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors that are present on cell surfaces.[42] As such, stopping these virus‐cell binding interactions via competitive inhibitors can prevent infection and various classes of sulfonated polysaccharides have been explored, including heparin[43] and heparin‐like molecules[44] along with metal complexes of sulfonated molecules, and exhibit antiviral activity in vitro.[45] Many of these antiviral molecules have been explored as topical microbicides to prevent vaginal transmission of viruses such as HIV, however, none have demonstrated efficacy in late‐stage clinical trials and intracorporeal efficacy is more challenging to achieve.[46] In light of these shortcomings and the potential utility of this biomimetic design concept in principle, there has been extensive interest in developing sulfonated nanoparticles with a well‐controlled, multivalent presentation of sulfonate groups to inhibit susceptible viruses. Baram‐Pinto et al. reported that sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection of Vero cells in vitro by preventing cell entry of virus particles and hence reducing cell‐to‐cell spreading as well.[47] Notably, the sulfonate groups in that study were attached to gold nanoparticles via short‐chain linkers with low conformational flexibility. Cagno et al. further investigated the design of sulfonate‐functionalized gold nanoparticles with short‐chain, low‐flexibility and long‐chain, high‐flexibility linkers and discovered that the use of more flexible chains enabled improved antiviral activity in vitro with Vero cells, ex vivo with human epivaginal tissue cultures, and in vivo in mice (Figure 3a).[48] While both types of sulfonate‐functionalized nanoparticles could bind to and inhibit viruses such as HSV‐2, only the nanoparticles with flexible linkers could inhibit viruses upon dilution due to stronger binding interactions and heparin was also inactive (Figure 3b–d). Electron microscopy imaging further revealed that nanoparticle‐virus particle interactions in the latter case resulted in virus particle disruption, indicating a virucidal (“virus‐killing”) type of mechanism (Figure 3e–g). Intranasal administration of the sulfonated nanoparticles also prophylactically inhibited respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice in vivo.

Sulfonate‐functionalized inorganic nanoparticles as virucidal inhibitors to disrupt virus particles. a) Schematic illustration of nanoparticle strategies to inhibit virus particles that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on cellular surfaces during the infection process. The basic concept is to create biomimetic nanoparticles with sulfonate groups that can tightly bind to virus particles to prevent virus binding to HSPG cell receptors. Top row: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with low‐flexibility 3‐mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES), termed MES‐AuNPs, can bind relatively weakly to virus particles to prevent infection. However, the inhibitory effect of MES‐AuNPs is lost upon dilution and the virus particles remain infective. Bottom: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with high‐flexibility undecanesulfonic acid (MUS), termed MUS‐AuNPs, can bind relatively strongly to virus particles and prevent infection. The inhibitory effect of MUS‐AuNPs is maintained upon dilution and nullifies viral infectivity due to irreversible virus particle disruption.

Building on this work, Zacheo et al. recently explored how controlling the properties of the sulfonated ligands on the gold nanoparticle surface affects the degree of antiviral activity and identified glucose‐ and lactose‐based ligands with virucidal activity against Dengue virus to inhibit infection of Vero and human liver‐derived HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro.[49] Dey et al. have also reported the fabrication of ≈100–200 nm diameter, hydrogel‐like sulfonated nanogel particles and demonstrated that the nanogels can block HSV‐1 infection of monkey kidney‐derived Vero E6 cells in vitro.[50] Importantly, several types of nanogels were designed with different degrees of flexibility and more flexible nanogels showed greater antiviral activity. Cyclodextrin scaffolds functionalized with mercaptoundecane sulfonic acids have also exhibited broad‐spectrum antiviral activity against numerous medically important viruses and further testing showed that HSV did not acquire resistance to the sulfonated cyclodextrin scaffolds.[51] The in vitro antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of money kidney‐derived Vero‐CCL81 and Vero E6 cells has been described in at least two recent works,[52] supporting that nanomaterial strategies involving sulfonate groups might be effective antiviral strategies to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 as well. 4.2.2 Sialylated Nanoparticles Different viruses bind to specific types of cell surface receptors as part of the infection process and another key example involves the influenza virus, which is a leading cause of respiratory viral infections.[53] Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins on the influenza virus particle surface bind to sialic acid‐containing glycan molecules that are prevalent on the surface of human lung cells as well as those of different animal species.[54] As with sulfonate‐related binding interactions and protein–glycan interactions in general, individual events of viral protein binding to sialic acids are relatively weak and strong interactions depend on multivalency.[55] Accordingly, a wide range of nanomaterial scaffolds with multiple sialic acid residues have been designed to competitively bind to influenza virus particles and thus prevent viral infection. Recent efforts have focused on how precisely tuning the distance between sialic acid residues on the scaffold affects HA binding. For example, Bandlow et al. investigated how rigid scaffolds composed of self‐assembled complexes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) enhanced binding interactions compared to more flexible, polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.[56] This finding agreed well with antiviral testing data on rigid and flexible core trivalent sialosides too.[57] Another important design variable has been considering linear versus branched scaffolds.[58] In one promising example, Kwon et al. reported the fabrication of a branched polyamidoamine scaffold that mirrored the inter‐spacing distance between HA proteins on influenza virus particles and intranasal administration of this scaffold was able to protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection.[59] Other recent examples include more sophisticated nanomaterial designs involving three‐way nucleic acid junctions[60] and star glycopolymers.[61] In addition to polymer‐like scaffolds, there has been ongoing exploration of sialic‐functionalized nanoparticles and a key example involves bacteriophage capsid nanoparticles with well‐controlled spacing of sialic acid‐functionalized ligands (Figure 4a,b).[62] Capsid nanoparticles with the correct Sia1 sialic acid ligands could specifically bind to influenza virus particles while nanoparticles functionalized with other glycan ligands did not bind to virus particles (Figure 4c,d). Likewise, only Sia1‐functionalized nanoparticles could inhibit influenza virus infection of MDCK‐II and human lung‐derived A549 cells in vitro in a dose‐dependent fashion and influenza virus pretreatment with the nanoparticles also protected mice from infection‐related weight loss in vivo (Figure 4e,f).

Richard et al. have also systematically investigated how sialic acid‐functionalized gold nanoparticles can be designed in terms of core nanoparticle size and linker length and unraveled how these parameters influence multivalent binding interactions, which can give rise to highly specific binding to particular ligand geometries.[63] In terms of soft‐matter nanoparticles, Bhatia et al. have also investigated the design of ≈250 nm diameter sialylated nanogel particles with varying degrees of flexibility and observed that highly flexible nanogel particles inhibited cell attachment of influenza virus by up to 400 times, as compared to more rigid nanogel particles.[64] The flexible nanogel particles also prevented influenza infection of MDCK‐II cells in vitro down to picomolar concentrations. In another interesting example, Kong et al. reported the development of sialic acid‐functionalized lipid nanodisks that can bind to and cause perforation of influenza virus particles.[65] This example demonstrated that sialic acid‐functionalized nanoparticles can exhibit additional mechanistic functions beyond inhibiting virus‐cell interactions only and intravenous administration of the nanodisks also protected mice against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo. In addition to new nanoparticle designs, there has been extensive recent progress in developing nanoscience measurement tools to quantify influenza viral protein‐sialic acid binding interactions. For example, single‐molecule force spectroscopy experiments have been conducted to comparatively measure the binding strength of influenza HA and neuraminidase proteins to sialic acid receptors[66] and the effects of multivalency on such interactions.[67] Di Iorio et al. have also fabricated sialic acid‐functionalized lipid bilayers and measured the binding of ≈22 nm diameter clusters of recombinant influenza HA proteins to supported lipid bilayers by quartz crystal microbalance‐dissipation (QCM‐D) experiments.[68] Other techniques such as microcavity arrays can also measure the diffusional motion of HA proteins bound to sialic acid‐functionalized supported lipid bilayers.[69] To date, most of these measurement strategies have been employed for understanding the fundamental role of multivalency in viral protein–glycan interactions while there remains tremendous potential to utilize these approaches for evaluating the functional performance of new nanomaterial inhibitors as well as to test drug inhibitor candidates that prevent such interactions.[70] 4.2.3 Additional Strategies In addition to glycan‐based decoy binding strategies for competitive inhibition, nucleic acid nanostructures have enabled creative design possibilities based on self‐assembling, complex topologies. For example, Kwon et al. reported the design of 3D DNA nanostructures with highly precise architectural features and incorporated Dengue viral protein‐binding aptamers within the nanostructure, which could bind multivalently to Dengue virus particles.[71] Different nanostructures such as heptagons, hexagons, and stars were tested and it was discovered that the star nanostructure yielded the most potent inhibitory activity to prevent Dengue virus infection of Vero cells in vitro. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to inhibit Dengue virus was around 2 × 10−9 m for star nanostructures, as compared to 10 × 10−9 and 440 × 10−9 m for the hexagon and heptagon nanostructures, respectively. This example provides an important demonstration of how synthetic receptors can be engineered in the future to develop more potent nanomaterial options, especially from natural, biocompatible materials, and with self‐assembling properties. These synthetic capabilities have also inspired current efforts to develop nanomaterial inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 based on understanding what receptor the virus binds and how to design receptor‐mimicking decoys. Specifically, the latest scientific evidence supports that SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the membrane‐associated angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell surfaces as part of the infection process.[72] Han et al. have reported the computational design of peptides that correspond to structurally important regions of ACE2 and can bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins to prevent infection.[73] It was suggested that the inhibitory peptides could be attached to nanoparticles with multivalent presentation, while such design strategies would require a careful consideration of how to best optimize the peptide attachment in terms of attachment chemistry, flexibility, density, and peptide conformation. There is also interest in engineering the ACE2 protein to bind more strongly to SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope proteins[74] and experimental work to test antiviral peptide inhibitors in this direction is ongoing. 4.3 Cell Membrane Decoys Over the past decade, there has been extensive and rapidly growing interest in coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane extracts to confer advantageous biological properties. For example, Hu et al. demonstrated that coating polymeric nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes can increase circulation time in mice.[75] It has also been demonstrated that cloaking polymeric nanoparticles with the plasma membrane of human platelets can improve immunocompatibility in terms of lower macrophage uptake and reduced complement activation, along with additional platelet‐like functionalities.[76] Ongoing progress in the field has also sparked interest in developing cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles that contain virus‐binding receptors and hence can bind to virus particles in order to prevent infection.[77] Numerous viruses such as Dengue and Zika are transmitted by mosquito vectors[78] and Rao et al. demonstrated that gelatin nanoparticles coated with mosquito cell membrane extracts can bind to Zika virus particles, whereby each ≈130 nm diameter nanoparticle binds to multiple virus particles.[79] This approach led to dose‐dependent reduction in viral infectivity of Vero cells in vitro and intravenous administration of the coated nanoparticles up to 2 days postinoculation also protected mice against virus‐induced mortality and body weight loss and reduced the level of viral infection in the brain. Red blood cell membrane‐coated magnetic nanoparticles with sialylated functional groups have also been employed to capture influenza virus particles.[80] In addition to using natural cell membrane extracts that contain typical amounts of virus‐binding receptors, there have been attempts to engineer cells to overexpress those receptors and to prepare cell‐derived membrane vesicles accordingly. For example, Liu et al. devised a biosynthetic strategy to overexpress the membrane receptor of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is called human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), in HepG2 cells and prepared ≈200 nm diameter, cell membrane‐derived vesicles that were used to inhibit HBV infection of HepG2‐hNTCP cells in vitro and in mice with humanized livers in vivo (Figure 5a).[81] Compared to control membrane vesicles from the parent cell line with normal receptor quantities, the membrane vesicles from the engineered cell line with an overexpressed quantity of receptors exhibited appreciably greater antiviral activity levels and demonstrated improved treatment efficacy in the mouse model, as indicated by lower levels of HBV antibodies and nucleic acid copies (Figure 5b,c). Recently, Rao et al. reported the fabrication of cell membrane‐derived vesicles from human monocyte cells that were genetically engineered to express the ACE2 receptor and the ACE2‐functionalized vesicles could prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro.[82] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint [ 81 ] Copyright 2018, Wiley‐VCH. d) Strategy to capture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus particles by using cell‐membrane‐coated polymeric nanoparticles termed nanosponges (NS).

Similar approaches have also been taken to treat and prevent infection by HIV, which is known to infect T cells.[83] Polymeric nanoparticles were coated with the plasma membranes of CD4+ T cells, which contain the receptors needed for virus binding and cell entry, and the cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human‐monocyte‐derived macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, it was suggested that this cell membrane decoy strategy could be potentially advantageous to work against multiple, genetically diverse HIV strains because all strains bind to the same cell receptors.[85] A follow‐up study confirmed that the T cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles could inhibit a wide range of HIV‐1 strains and surprisingly induced autophagy of HIV‐infected cells to suppress viral genome replication but had no effect on uninfected cells.[86] Recently, cell membrane‐coated nanoparticles have also been developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro (Figure 5d).[84] Nanoparticles coated with extracts from human lung epithelial type II or macrophage cells inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent fashion while nanoparticles coated with extracts from red blood cells were inactive (Figure 5e). These findings emphasize the importance of rationally designing biomimetic nanomaterial strategies based on a precise understanding of how a certain virus affects cells, and further research is needed to clarify the potential utility of these inhibitory capabilities in vivo.

5 Viral Membrane Inhibitors Most nanomaterial‐based antiviral strategies focus on targeting viral protein components in order to prevent virus‐cell binding interactions as described in the preceding examples. However, various types of viruses use distinct binding receptors to enter cells and such strategies are therefore intrinsically limited to working against a relatively narrow subset of viruses. On the other hand, many viral epidemics are caused by membrane‐enveloped viruses and a structurally intact viral membrane on enveloped viruses is necessary for viral infectivity, including virus‐cell fusion.[87] As such, a wide range of broad‐spectrum antiviral drug candidates have been explored to inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses based on targeting the viral membrane.[87] One of the most exciting groups of drug candidates within this class are membrane‐disruptive, antiviral peptides that inhibit membrane‐enveloped viruses in order to abrogate viral infectivity.[88] Several antiviral peptides have been discovered that inhibit a wide range of membrane‐enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)[89] and HIV,[90] and include a 27‐mer amphipathic, α‐helical (AH) peptide that exhibits membrane‐curvature‐selective disruptive activity to inhibit small, membrane‐enveloped virus particles of ≈160 nm diameter or smaller.[91] In vitro antiviral testing experiments against various types of membrane‐enveloped and nonenveloped viruses have been conducted using a wide range of permissive, model cell lines such as Vero cells and human liver‐derived Huh 7.5 cells as well as primary cells such as mouse neuronal cells and human T cells. The results have demonstrated that some membrane‐active peptides exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses down to the nanomolar range along with low cell cytotoxicity.[92] While viral envelopes are derived from host cell membranes, the AH peptide and possibly other peptides can exhibit selective rupture of highly curved viral membranes due to membrane‐curvature‐triggered membrane disruption.[93] Indeed, mammalian cells are much larger than virus particles and hence possess an appreciably lower degree of membrane curvature and this curvature difference provides a distinguishing factor between viral and mammalian cell membranes.[94] These promising mechanistic features have motivated researchers to explore how to utilize viral‐membrane‐targeting, antiviral peptides in vivo, while exploring design strategies to overcome traditional challenges of peptide therapeutics, such as high susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and short circulation time.[95] To overcome these challenges, Jackman et al. explored the development of an engineered version of the AH peptide, composed of all D‐amino acids and termed AH‐D, which was able to therapeutically treat lethal Zika virus infection in a mouse model in vivo.[92] The basic design concept was called lipid envelope antiviral disruption (LEAD) and posited that extracellular targeting of membrane‐enveloped viruses can reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in order to help curb viral infection (Figure 6a). Upon intravenous administration of the AH‐D peptide starting 3 days post‐virus inoculation, over 80% of mice survived Zika virus infection and exhibited markedly reduced clinical symptoms in general. Importantly, the AH‐D peptide was able to significantly reduce the concentration of infectious virus particles in the blood as well as in multiple organs, including in the brain (Figure 6b). More extensive studies revealed that the AH‐D peptide is able to cross the intact blood‐brain barrier to treat Zika virus infection directly in the brain as well as to reduce infection‐related brain inflammation (Figure 6c,d).

From a material science perspective, another noteworthy point is that a large portion of the mechanistic understanding about how AH and AH‐D peptides work has been obtained from biosensing measurement strategies involving biomimetic, virus‐particle‐mimicking vesicles in combination with acoustic‐, optical‐, nanoplasmonic‐, and fluorescence‐microscopy‐based techniques.[91, 96] Examples include nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and plasmonic nanohole sensors[97] (Figure 6e–i). Such insights have led to further exploration of the AH‐D peptide as an antiviral drug candidate to prevent Zika virus infection of fetuses in pregnant mice[98] and forward‐looking discussion about how the LEAD concept could be useful for broadly treating mosquito‐borne virus infections, including not only Zika but also Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever among various possibilities.[99] This capability could be especially beneficial when a mosquito‐borne viral infection is clinically suspected but a differential diagnosis of the specific virus type is challenging.[100] The LEAD concept might be generally applicable to other types of membrane‐enveloped viruses as well since the viral membrane represents an Achilles heel and there is a high barrier to the emergence of drug‐resistant strains because the viral membrane is derived from host cell membranes and not encoded within the viral genome.[101] It has even been suggested that membrane‐enveloped SARS‐CoV‐2 might be susceptible to viral membrane disruption[102] and these aspects are particularly important because SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the brain has been linked to a wide range of COVID‐19 disease conditions.[103] While intravenously administered, antiviral peptides have demonstrated initial promise in some mouse models of viral infections, nanomaterial‐based drug delivery strategies could improve pharmacological activities and lead to improved targeting possibilities. Zhang et al. have reported the development of a cationic, membrane‐active antiviral peptide that was mixed together with anionic polymer chains to form ≈35 nm diameter nanoparticles.[104] These peptide‐polymer nanoparticles exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against HCV infection of Huh 7.5 cells and HIV infection of TZM‐bl cells, human lymphocytes, and monocyte‐derived macrophages, respectively, and also showed lower levels of hemolytic activity against red blood cells than the free peptide alone. Intramuscular injection of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles showed improved treatment of HIV‐1 infection in a mouse model in vivo, as compared to free peptide alone. In a follow‐up study, a refined version of the peptide‐polymer nanoparticles was developed that was functionalized with galactosyl sugar molecules in order to enable improved HepG2 cell internalization in vitro and preferential liver accumulation in mice in vivo.[105] Ongoing work can further expand the potential of targeting membrane‐enveloped viruses by using antiviral peptides and other classes of small‐molecule inhibitors[106] that impair viral membrane‐associated proteins to prevent virus‐cell fusion in combination with nanomaterial strategies to enhance targeted delivery prospects. In addition to directly targeting virus particles, it might be possible to also disrupt membrane‐enveloped exosomes that carry viral components such as nucleic acids and proteins and can be involved in viral infection and transmission processes.[107]

6 Virus‐Removing Blood Filters Another approach to effectively remove circulating virus particles from the blood of infected hosts has relied on the use of extracorporeal blood‐filtering devices and advances upon medical device technology that was originally used to treat sepsis infections.[108] Early work by Kang et al. demonstrated that a microfluidic device can effectively remove a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood.[109] To achieve this objective, ≈130 nm diameter magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) protein molecules, which can bind to sugar molecules found on the surface of various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses along with endotoxins.[110] The MBL‐functionalized nanoparticles were mixed together with circulating blood, could bind to circulating pathogens, and then the nanoparticle‐pathogen mixtures could be magnetically separated before the blood was returned to the host. In rat models of bacterial infection, more than 90% of bacteria were reduced along with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Seiler et al. have further explored the use of an engineered version of MBL that demonstrated improved pathogen capture in blood and urine samples.[111] Based on these findings, there has been ongoing progress to develop extracorporeal blood filters for virus particle removal applications as well. Tullis et al. demonstrated that hemodialysis treatment using a hollow‐fiber cartridge that contained antibody‐functionalized agarose beads could effectively remove HIV‐1 virus particles and viral proteins from cell culture media and blood.[112] These capabilities have led to the exploration of clinical‐stage medical device technology to broadly capture a wide range of circulating virus particles by replacing the antibody functionalization with MBL functionalization. Early reports indicated preliminary testing success to capture HIV and HCV virus particles along with binding to Dengue, influenza, Ebola, and Marburg viral proteins.[113] A pilot human clinical trial using a full‐scale version of this medical device technology was used to remove HCV from the blood of 4 HCV‐positive patients and resulted in an average drop in HCV viral loads of around 57%.[114] Follow‐up studies showed HCV viral load reductions in additional patients and it was further suggested that continuous application of this treatment approach could potentially reduce HCV to clinically undetectable levels within a few days, especially if used in combination with conventional antiviral drug therapies.[115] Büttner et al. have also reported that the medical device technology has been used to treat one patient with Ebola virus infection[116] and recent works have explored how these extracorporeal blood filters might be useful to remove coronaviruses and Marburg virus from infected blood.[117] With respect to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, it has also been noted that virus‐removing blood filters could be a useful technology.[118] Given the small number of patients in the aforementioned clinical testing, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present stage, however, there are bright prospects to continue exploring virus‐removing blood filter technology. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the initiation of a feasibility study, with up to 40 human patients, to test the treatment efficacy of an extracorporeal blood filter based on this medical device technology for patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis and severe COVID‐19 disease.[119] In terms of future innovation in this direction, it is important to continue exploring how to develop improved filtration devices while also creating new biofunctionalization strategies to improve virus‐binding capacity and perhaps apply peptide functionalization schemes to catalytically damage virus particles as opposed to intact virus particle binding alone. Looking forward, these medical device technologies can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antiviral drug therapies to lower the amount of infectious virus particles in blood while also inhibiting the production of new virus particles among other possibilities.

7 Virus‐Mimicking Nanoparticle Vaccines 7.1 Design Rationale There has also been tremendous progress in developing nanoparticle‐based vaccine strategies to prevent and treat viral infections. In general, viral infections provoke the immune system, which can recognize viral proteins on the virus particle surface (“antigens”) and produce antibodies that bind to these antigens to neutralize virus particles.[120] In some cases, natural antibodies produced in response to a viral infection can have extremely high specificity and potency to inhibit virus particles.[121] For these reasons, the blood plasma from patients who recover from a certain type of virus infection is often given as a medical treatment to infected patients afflicted with the same type of virus infection.[122] In such cases, the plasma can contain high levels of neutralizing antibodies that bind to and inhibit virus particles.[123] However, the specific types and concentrations of antibodies present in blood plasma vary from person‐to‐person, potentially limiting reliable clinical use.[124] Hence, there has been extensive interest in recombinantly manufacturing specific, highly potent neutralizing antibodies as an alternative treatment option.[125] This latter approach allows more precise control over antibody composition and dosing. Recombinant antibody therapies also reduce the risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) side effects, which can arise in some cases from non‐neutralizing antibodies that are also present in plasma.[125, 126] The same logic applies to vaccine development where the key objective is to administer a virus‐mimicking immunogenic material so that a strong and focused immune response can be trained. The target objective is to generate high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies while minimizing production of non‐neutralizing antibodies that can otherwise inadvertently promote virus infection in some cases. Over the past few years, virus‐mimicking nanomaterial design strategies have been at the forefront of creating next‐generation vaccine strategies now reaching human clinical trials. The combination of nanomaterials, biomimetics, and protein engineering has led to unprecedented capabilities to rationally finetune immune responses and elicit high levels of potent neutralizing antibodies in a safe and effective manner. These capabilities are currently being extended to develop a nanoparticle vaccine candidate to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Recent progress in the field highlights the merits of both natural and engineered protein scaffolds to create self‐assembling, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines with excellent biomechanical and immunological properties. The fast‐moving progress on this subject is reviewed in this section along with coverage of other vaccine nanoparticle strategies. 7.2 Types of Nanoparticle Vaccines There is broad interest in integrating material science and protein engineering strategies to develop safe, virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines that present viral protein antigens in a highly organized and symmetrical manner in order to induce strong immune responses.[127] Compared to free antigens, nanoparticle vaccines have several compelling advantages, including greater antigen stability, multivalent presentation of antigens, and targeted delivery.[128] As such, nanoparticle vaccines can bind multivalently to multiple receptors on B cells, which are immune cells involved in antibody production, resulting in more robust immune responses and high levels of immune protection.[24] A wide variety of nanoparticle types are being explored to prevent infectious diseases in general, including self‐assembling protein nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomal nanoparticles, and polymer scaffolds.[129] Key design considerations include optimizing the antigen structure (more precisely, the immunogen structure) to elicit the desired immune response, tuning vaccine delivery, and inducing focused immune responses.[130] From a biomimetic perspective, one of the most promising recent design advances has involved self‐assembled nanoparticle vaccines as discussed below along with introducing other nanoparticle vaccine design strategies. 7.2.1 Natural Protein Scaffolds The earliest example of a natural protein scaffold to form a nanoparticle vaccine involved the use of ferritin, which self‐assembles into nearly spherical, hollow nanoparticles that have ≈12 nm core diameter and are composed of 24 protein molecules with symmetrical organization.[131] By overcoming several challenges related to protein glycosylation and oligomerization, Kanekiyo et al. first reported the design of a ferritin‐based, influenza nanoparticle vaccine in 2013 that presented eight trimers of influenza HA viral protein on the nanoparticle surface in a native‐like configuration that enabled a superior immune response to conventionally used influenza vaccine strategies based on inactivated virus particles.[132] From a material science perspective, the key innovation was controlling the location at which ferritin and HA were genetically fused together in order to recombinantly express ferritin‐HA fusion proteins that self‐assembled into nanoparticles with repetitively spaced, trimeric HA spikes (Figure 7a,b). Ferritin‐HA nanoparticle immunization induced a strong immune response, as indicated by high levels of neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza H1N1 strains and protection against influenza virus infection in a ferret model (Figure 7c,d). Recently, Kelly et al. have elucidated how ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccination in mice triggers principally germinal center expansion and maturation of memory B cells, which are involved in antibody production.[133] In another study, Yassine et al. further explored the development of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines that presented a truncated version of HA, which corresponded to the stem region that is conserved across different HA subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and hence its trimeric presentation on the nanoparticle surface conferred protection against a wider range of influenza subtypes in mouse and ferret models.[134] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ).

Ferritin nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed to prevent infections from viruses such as HIV‐1 and Sliepen et al. first reported the design of ferritin nanoparticles presenting HIV‐1 envelope (Env) protein trimers, which demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity in mice and rabbits.[136] Neutralizing antibodies were generated to inhibit some but not all HIV‐1 strains, and it was particularly challenging to inhibit certain strains classified as “difficult‐to‐neutralize”.[137] It was discussed how the nanoparticle design might be improved by reducing steric hindrance between adjacent Env trimers. He et al. refined the structure‐based design of the trimeric Env antigens presented on the ferritin nanoparticle surface along with optimizing spacing between the trimers in order to yield more robust B cell responses.[138] More detailed engineering of the Env antigen structure increased Env trimer recognition on the ferritin nanoparticles by a broader range of naïve B cells, resulting in elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.[139] Due to the high sequence variation among Env proteins across different HIV‐1 strains, Sliepen et al. have designed a new Env antigen structure based on a consequence sequence incorporating the epitopes of many broadly neutralizing antibodies, and presented the Env antigen trimers on ferritin nanoparticles to yield strong neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits and macaques.[140] In addition, He et al. have reported additional protein engineering efforts to improve the stability of wild‐type Env antigens by switching out the ectodomain with a more stable version from an engineered Env antigen, which enabled improved generation of neutralizing antibodies that can inhibit difficult‐to‐neutralize HIV‐1 strains, in mice and rabbits.[141] Together, the ongoing work with ferritin‐Env nanoparticle vaccines to prevent HIV‐1 infection demonstrates the superior immune responses generated by antigen trimers on the nanoparticle surface, while highlighting the potential to combine these nanomaterial efforts with antigen‐based protein engineering efforts. Such possibilities have also been explored for a wide range of other viruses and support the broad versatility of ferritin nanoparticle technology for developing next‐generation vaccines. Kanekiyo et al. have designed a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) infection by conjugating ferritin molecules to a truncated domain from the EBV gp350 protein that contains the receptor‐binding site needed for B cell infection.[142] On the ferritin nanoparticle surface, the antigen formed dimers, which is a distinct conformation to the trimeric presentation cases discussed above. Importantly, compared to the soluble gp350 antigen, the nanoparticle vaccine still elicited markedly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies by 10‐ to 100‐fold in mice and nonhuman primates and also conferred protective immunity on mice in a lethal virus challenge model. Bu et al. have also developed another form of a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine to prevent EBV infection based on a different antigen (gH), which alone and in complexation with gL and gp42 proteins helps to generate neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus‐cell fusion and works against multiple cell types instead of only preventing B cell infection.[143] In another important example, Wang et al. have reported a dual‐targeting, ferritin nanoparticle vaccine strategy to prevent and treat chronic HBV infection in mice based on activating two types of immune cells to induce high and persistent levels of neutralizing antibodies.[144] Recent work has further demonstrated that ferritin nanoparticles are an excellent platform to present viral antigens for developing HCV vaccines that might work against a wide range of HCV genotypes[145] and also to develop vaccines for treating RSV infection.[146] Notably, in the latter case, a glycosylated version of the RSV antigen was designed that induced a higher ratio of neutralizing antibodies to non‐neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates, which could be significant because higher levels of non‐neutralizing antibodies are thought to be associated with antibody‐mediated disease enhancement.[146] In addition to fabricating ferritin nanoparticles composed of one type of building block component, there has been interest in developing two‐component ferritin nanoparticles in order to present oligomers of multiple antigens on the nanoparticle surface. For example, Georgiev et al. reported the development of ferritin nanoparticles composed of two types of ferritin constructs, one of which was fused to an influenza virus antigen and the other one of which was fused to an HIV‐1 antigen, and nanoparticle self‐assembly resulted in trimeric presentation of both antigens.[147] Importantly, vaccination with this nanoparticle strategy in guinea pigs could induce neutralizing antibodies that inhibited both viruses. Since there are many different subtypes of influenza virus, Kanekiyo et al. expanded on this nanoparticle design strategy to design and coassemble ferritin‐HA constructs encoding HA with one of two receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) and the resulting nanoparticles had mosaic HA trimers that presented a mixture of RBDs to yield a broader antibody response than nanoparticles with either RBD alone.[148] Vaccination in mice led to the discovery of a neutralizing antibody that works against a wide range of influenza virus strains. Accordingly, nanoparticle‐based strategies presenting multiple antigens have been suggested as one possible route to create a universal influenza vaccine.[25] While ferritin nanoparticles have proven useful for creating vaccine nanoparticle technology, there has been extensive interest in identifying other natural protein scaffolds that can self‐assemble into nanoparticles with different sizes. Also in 2013, Jardine et al. reported the development of ≈32 nm diameter, self‐assembling nanoparticles composed of 60 recombinantly expressed lumazine synthase (LS) protein molecules from Aquifex aeolicus, which exhibit symmetrical organization, and designed an LS fusion protein together with HIV‐1 Env antigen that could form nanoparticles with enhanced B cell activation and lymph node trafficking properties.[149] In follow‐up work, an improved version of the LS nanoparticle vaccine platform was designed and induced promising immune responses in different mouse models in vivo, toward the goal of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV‐1 infection.[150] Havenar‐Daughton et al. further investigated single‐dose immunization of rhesus monkeys with this HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccine and noted that subcutaneous immunization yielded markedly larger B cell responses and lymph node drainage than intramuscular drainage.[151] Tokatlian et al. have also explored how antigen glycosylation of LS‐ and ferritin‐based HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines is an important factor in modulating antibody responses (Figure 7e,f).[135] The results demonstrated that antigen glycosylation is an important factor in eliciting high levels of antigen‐specific antibody levels and appreciably lower levels were observed with deglycosylated antigen (Figure 7g). Additionally, Krebs et al. have investigated ≈23 nm diameter nanoparticle self‐assembly from the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in order to create nanoparticle vaccines presenting an HIV‐1 Env antigen fragment, which yielded an antigen‐specific antibody in immunized rabbits although multiple rounds of immunization were needed to elicit moderately protective, neutralizing antibody levels in a large fraction of rabbits.[152] As seen in these examples, it is important to point out that self‐assembled nanoparticles from different natural protein scaffolds have distinct functionalities, as noted by how protein scaffolds fused together with full‐length viral protein antigens can only self‐assemble into nanoparticles for some, but not all, of the scaffold options and antigen spacing is another important factor affecting both nanoparticle self‐assembly and immunogenicity.[138] In part, such design issues have motivated the use of full‐length viral proteins or truncated versions thereof and the type of nanoparticle structure can also affect antigen oligomerization in some cases.[142] Another important point concerns the nanoparticle vaccine fabrication strategy. To date, the structural components of virus‐mimicking nanoparticle vaccines have been recombinantly expressed in host cells in vitro and, upon expression, spontaneously self‐assemble into antigen‐presenting nanoparticles. In such cases, the nanoparticle vaccine suspension is then injected into animals as part of the immunization process. As an alternative strategy, recent work has also investigated nucleic‐acid‐based vaccination strategies that could enable the in vivo expression of nanoparticle structural components and, in some cases, in vivo self‐assembly of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. Melo et al. reported the development of a lipid‐nanoparticle‐encapsulated alphavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) replicon encoding the HIV Env antigen fused with LS.[153] A single injection of this lipid nanoparticle suspension encoding the HIV Env antigen yielded high levels of Env‐specific antibodies and also led to improved B cell responses compared to recombinant protein immunization. In another demonstration, Xu et al. reported the use of a DNA vaccine plasmid to induce the in vivo expression of a nanoparticle structural component comprising an HIV Env antigen fused with LS, and demonstrated its in vivo structural assembly in mice based on functional studies along with improved immune responses in mice and guinea pigs compared to immunization with a similar delivery strategy encoding antigen monomers only.[154] The design concept was further generalized to other natural protein scaffolds, such as ferritin nanoparticles, which also induced high immune responses and the delivery strategy could also be adapted to influenza HA antigen in order to endow mice with protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge. From a translational perspective, there has been tremendous progress in developing ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccines for preventing influenza infections based on ongoing human clinical trials being conducted in the United States. Preliminary data from the first‐in‐human trial (NCT03186781) of a ferritin‐HA nanoparticle vaccine provided initial evidence that the vaccine is safe and well‐tolerated in humans while another human clinical trial (NCT03814720) is ongoing to evaluate the dosing, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ferritin‐HA‐stem nanoparticles as a potential universal flu vaccine candidate. 7.2.2 Engineered Protein Scaffolds The insights gained from nanoparticle vaccines based on self‐assembling natural protein scaffolds have highlighted the importance of tuning antigen structure, conformation, density, and spacing on the nanoparticle surface. While several types of self‐assembling proteins exist in nature, the number of options is intrinsically limited, which has prompted researchers to further explore the design of nanoparticle vaccines from self‐assembling, engineered protein scaffolds that enable greater control over nanomaterial properties. Toward this goal, King et al. reported computational strategies to design 24‐subunit protein nanomaterials composed of two types of self‐assembling protein subunit components, and experimentally demonstrated that it was possible to rationally tune the nanomaterial structure, shape, and symmetry in alignment with the computational designs.[155] In another study, Bale et al. applied similar approaches to design larger, two‐component protein nanomaterials composed of 120 subunits with icosahedral symmetry and had 24–40 nm diameters that are similar to the size of small viral capsids.[156] Another advantage of using two‐component engineered proteins is greater control over the fabrication process. Natural protein scaffolds self‐assemble upon recombinant expression while engineered protein components can be expressed independently and then mixed as desired to self‐assemble into nanoparticles in vitro. Marcandalli et al. reported the first example of an engineered‐protein‐based nanoparticle vaccine that was built from two self‐assembling components and presented multiple copies of a trimeric RSV envelope antigen termed DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8a,b).[157] One protein component was designed to present DS‐Cav1 and spontaneously formed trimers by itself, while the other protein component formed pentamers by itself. The two protein components were expressed independently and, when mixed together in vitro, 20 trimers of the first protein component and 12 pentamers of the second protein component self‐assembled to form two‐component nanoparticles with ≈55 nm diameter inclusive of the antigen trimer spikes. Unlike previous nanoparticle vaccine designs, it was possible to control the density of DS‐Cav1 antigen trimer on the nanoparticle surface based on mixing different amounts of the first protein component with a genetically fused version of the first protein component that presents DS‐Cav1 (Figure 8c). Importantly, the nanoparticle presentation of DS‐Cav1 trimers not only improved antigen physical stability but also nanoparticle vaccine immunization in mice and nonhuman primates led to nearly 10‐fold higher neutralizing antibody titers along with a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response than immunization with soluble DS‐Cav1 trimers (Figure 8d). Brouwer et al. have also used a similar two‐component nanoparticle strategy to present HIV‐1 envelope antigen trimers.[158] In this case, the two‐component nanoparticle induced particularly high antibody responses after a single round of immunization, as compared to the same antigen trimers in soluble form and displayed on single‐component ferritin nanoparticles. There is ongoing exploration of different nanoparticle shape designs[159] and how nanoparticle formulations can improve lymph node targeting in nonhuman primate models.[160] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 50 ) and the bar indicates the geometric mean, which is listed for each test group.

In terms of COVID‐19 vaccine development, Walls et al. recently reported the development of a two‐component nanoparticle vaccine candidate that displays the RBD of a SARS‐CoV‐2 envelope protein antigen (Figure 8e).[161] From a nanomaterial design perspective, a key innovation was introducing a genetically encoded flexible linker to connect the smaller RBD domain with the main nanoparticle structure. It is also noteworthy that the basic self‐assembling nanoparticle design involved the same two protein components as in the RSV and HIV‐1 nanoparticle vaccines described above, demonstrating the modular nature of nanoparticle vaccines and the ability to rationally swap antigens to support rapid vaccine development (Figure 8f). Importantly, the COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine induced nearly ten‐fold greater neutralizing antibody titers in mice than a soluble antigen trimer even when the nanoparticles were administered at a five‐time lower dose (Figure 8g). The nanoparticle vaccine also induced a greater proportion of neutralizing antibodies in the antibody response, as compared to human convalescent sera. This immune response resulted in complete protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an in vivo virus challenge mouse model (Figure 8h). The combination of these features has further spurred ongoing manufacturing efforts to create a COVID‐19 nanoparticle vaccine in abundant quantities for potential human clinical trials. Looking forward, Ueda et al. have also continued designing new nanoparticle vaccine designs that are tailored for different types of viral protein domains[157] and there is excellent potential to continue exploring protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines. As control over the molecular‐level biomimetic features of protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines continues to improve, there will be growing emphasis on production scalability and how these nanoparticle vaccines can compete with other vaccine candidates in terms of practical factors such as cost, storage, and scalability. 7.2.3 Additional Scaffold Options While there has been tremendous progress in developing protein‐based nanoparticle vaccines to prevent viral infections, liposome‐ and inorganic nanoparticle‐based strategies have also proven advantageous and demonstrate important nanomaterial desi

 Related stories:Can Biden convince red states to wear masks?
Aide sees localized restrictions, not national lockdown...
NM, OR reimpose stay-at-ho…(Adds charts)

By Howard Schneider, Heather Timmons and Steve Holland

WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to make controlling the coronavirus a top priority and is likely to push for mask wearing mandates and more fiscal stimulus to keep businesses and workers afloat.

But in the two months until inauguration day on Jan. 20, skyrocketing infections could add more than 8 million more cases and 70,000 deaths, representing a potential 80% increase in infections and a 29% rise in deaths, according to Reuters calculations.

The only ways to change the outcome, experts said, are for President Donald Trump's outgoing administration to alter its strategy or state governments to introduce stricter and more coordinated measures. Colder weather adds to the challenge.

"The epidemic is going to be worse than it was in the spring, and worse than it was for the everyday American," said Gregg Gonsalves, a professor in epidemiology at Yale University and a health care activist.

Trump has shown less involvement in the White House coronavirus task force in recent weeks as he focused on his re-election campaign and an effort to challenge votes in several states after the Nov. 3 election.

Trump's coronavirus task force has been superseded by a multitude of regional task forces, "which is probably the least efficient solution, but better than nothing," said Greg Daco, chief economist from Oxford Economics.

U.S. states and cities announced a patchwork of new restrictions this week aimed at slowing the virus's spread.

A White House spokesman said the president's task force remains "focused on saving lives," and is "in constant contact with state and local jurisdictions and health care providers, and continues to promote common sense mitigation measures."

Since an election night party indoors at the White House where guests were mostly unmasked, several top Trump allies, including chief of staff Mark Meadows, have tested positive for coronavirus.

Meanwhile, it is looking less likely that Congress will pass significant additional fiscal stimulus before Biden takes office.

Infectious disease experts say the U.S. federal government should be doing much more right now.

"We could be trying to figure out how to give people support to stay home" rather than go to work, said Gonsalves. "We could pay them to stay home, we could send out masks to every American household."

INFECTIONS JUMP

The first wave of the coronavirus in spring hit big coastal cities and nursing homes, and a second spread through more rural states.

The third wave is spreading virtually unchecked throughout much of the United States, which surpassed 10 million reported cases this week and more than 125,000 new cases on Wednesday.

The country could report between 8 million and 13 million more cases of COVID-19 between now and the inauguration, according to Reuters calculations based on early November daily case count and percentage growth trends.

70,000 ADDITIONAL DEATHS OR MORE

At the current daily rate of deaths, another 70,000 to 150,000 Americans may die between now and Inauguration Day, according to Reuters calculations. As of Wednesday, over 243,000 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the United States.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has a similar estimate https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&tab=trend of just over 360,000 coronavirus deaths on Jan. 20 without any changes in mandates, an increase of 117,000 from Nov. 12.

ECONOMIC DRAG

Economists and analysts have been reluctant to calculate how the third wave of infection could impact the U.S. economy if it continues unchecked, citing too many variables from the possibility of fiscal stimulus to renewed lockdown measures.

The economy is likely to re-accelerate next spring, many predicted, when a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be introduced, ushering in a new boom in consumer consumption.

Between now and then, though, the tone is increasingly grim.

"The pace of recovery is likely to get worse before it gets batter," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Thursday. Fiscal support has "largely dried up" the analysts wrote, shrinking disposable income for the rest of the year.

If nothing changes between now and the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, "we may be in a very concerning, very alarming situation," Oxford's Daco said.

By Howard Schneider, Heather Timmons and Steve Holland

WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to make controlling the coronavirus a top priority and is likely to push for mask wearing mandates and more fiscal stimulus to keep businesses and workers afloat.

But in the two months until inauguration day on Jan. 20, skyrocketing infections could add more than 8 million more cases and 70,000 deaths, representing a potential 80% increase in infections and a 29% rise in deaths, according to Reuters calculations.

The only ways to change the outcome, experts said, are for President Donald Trump's outgoing administration to alter its strategy or state governments to introduce stricter and more coordinated measures. Colder weather adds to the challenge.

"The epidemic is going to be worse than it was in the spring, and worse than it was for the everyday American," said Gregg Gonsalves, a professor in epidemiology at Yale University and a health care activist.

Trump has shown less involvement in the White House coronavirus task force in recent weeks as he focused on his re-election campaign and an effort to challenge votes in several states after the Nov. 3 election.

Trump's coronavirus task force has been superseded by a multitude of regional task forces, "which is probably the least efficient solution, but better than nothing," said Greg Daco, chief economist from Oxford Economics.

U.S. states and cities announced a patchwork of new restrictions this week aimed at slowing the virus's spread.

A White House spokesman said the president's task force remains "focused on saving lives," and is "in constant contact with state and local jurisdictions and health care providers, and continues to promote common sense mitigation measures."

Since an election night party indoors at the White House where guests were mostly unmasked, several top Trump allies, including chief of staff Mark Meadows, have tested positive for coronavirus.

Meanwhile, it is looking less likely that Congress will pass significant additional fiscal stimulus before Biden takes office.

Infectious disease experts say the U.S. federal government should be doing much more right now.

"We could be trying to figure out how to give people support to stay home" rather than go to work, said Gonsalves. "We could pay them to stay home, we could send out masks to every American household."

INFECTIONS JUMP

The first wave of the coronavirus in spring hit big coastal cities and nursing homes, and a second spread through more rural states.

The third wave is spreading virtually unchecked throughout much of the United States, which surpassed 10 million reported cases this week and more than 125,000 new cases on Wednesday.

The country could report between 8 million and 13 million more cases of COVID-19 between now and the inauguration, according to Reuters calculations based on early November daily case count and percentage growth trends.

70,000 ADDITIONAL DEATHS OR MORE

At the current daily rate of deaths, another 70,000 to 150,000 Americans may die between now and Inauguration Day, according to Reuters calculations. As of Wednesday, over 243,000 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the United States.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has a similar estimate https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=total-deaths&tab=trend of just over 360,000 coronavirus deaths on Jan. 20 without any changes in mandates, an increase of 117,000 from Nov. 12.

ECONOMIC DRAG

Economists and analysts have been reluctant to calculate how the third wave of infection could impact the U.S. economy if it continues unchecked, citing too many variables from the possibility of fiscal stimulus to renewed lockdown measures.

The economy is likely to re-accelerate next spring, many predicted, when a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be introduced, ushering in a new boom in consumer consumption.

Between now and then, though, the tone is increasingly grim.

"The pace of recovery is likely to get worse before it gets batter," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Thursday. Fiscal support has "largely dried up" the analysts wrote, shrinking disposable income for the rest of the year.

If nothing changes between now and the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, "we may be in a very concerning, very alarming situation," Oxford's Daco said.

Patient readers, again I’ve been thrown off-stride by technical issues. I’ll have more shortly. –lambert. UPDATE All done!

Bird Song of the Day

Unfortunately, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology is down for scheduled maintenance, and won’t be back up until 8:00AM on November 19 (we hope). Here is a Red-Tailed Hawk cam instead:

#COVID19

At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart from 91-DIVOC. The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site.

Case count by United States region:

Test positivity by region:

Case fatality rate by region:

I added the death counts, and yes, deaths are rising as the case count rises; we’ll need to watch for that two-week lag.

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord

Election Legitimacy

The 2016 material below happened on December 14-16, right after I wrote “Federalist 68, the Electoral College, and Faithless Electors” on December 13, in which (see the final paragraphs) I was far too polite to use the word “coup.” (I went digging after I listened to the currentThe West Wing Thing podcast, “Swiss Diplomacy“, where they also quote the passage from Shattered where Podesta and Mook call a meeting in Brooklyn and decide to pin the loss on the Russians.) I missed it because I don’t watch television. “Celebrities are urging the Electoral College not to vote for Trump” [Business Insider]. “As part of a last-ditch effort to block Donald Trump from becoming the next US president, a host of celebrities appear in a PSA encouraging members of the Electoral College not to cast their vote for the president-elect. ‘The West Wing’ star Martin Sheen starts the Unite for America-sponsored pitch to the Republican members of the Electoral College.” • Oy. (“Unite for America”‘s website is dead, and it was made with SquareSpace, so it looks like a throwaway. But I don’t know which liberal Democrat pseudopodium funded the PSA. This article has what seems to be a proto-Great Assimilation™ Crew in the bio section: “Jon Gedney is a national organizer for Unite for America, Ryan Clayton is president of Americans Take Action, Chris Suprun was a 2016 presidential elector for the state of Texas, Michael Baca is the co-founder of the Hamilton Electors and Tom Hancock, PhD is a national grass roots organizer for the New Conservative Movement.” “National organizer for a thing with a dead website four years later. Oh… kay.) Here is the video: So all this liberal Democrat frothing and stamping about denying election legitimacy? Purest projection, from people who either have the memory of goldfish or are completely disingenuous. Or both! I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. And speaking of projection: ROUND OF APPLAUSE as we welcome Harvard Prof. Lawrence Lessig to today's episode of… How it started …. How it's going pic.twitter.com/xrrsHTBhii — Alice 🍃🐿️ 🪓🌹 (@AliceFromQueens) November 14, 2020 * * * WI: “Trump Will Have To Pay $7.9 Million If He Really Wants Wisconsin Recount” [Associated Press]. “The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday released the recount timeline and cost estimate, which was based on costs submitted by the 72 counties.”

2020 Democrats in Disarray

That’s a hell of an act. What do you call it? The right time to pressure elected officials, according to twitter 🙃 Primary – "you're gonna hurt our chances of winning!"

General – "first we have to win!"

After they win – "Can't we take a break?"

Once they're sworn in – "don't risk the midterms!" The right time is always. — Sunrise Movement 🌅 (@sunrisemvmt) November 17, 2020 The Democrats! Because being gay is always a punchline: 2. Enough of this…seriously. pic.twitter.com/w7Whuh2GPr — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) November 17, 2020

Biden Transition

Biden (D)(1): “Biden hopes to avoid divisive Trump investigations, preferring unity” [NBC]. “President-elect Joe Biden has privately told advisers that he doesn’t want his presidency to be consumed by investigations of his predecessor, according to five people familiar with the discussions, despite pressure from some Democrats who want inquiries into President Donald Trump, his policies and members of his administration. Biden has raised concerns that investigations would further divide a country he is trying to unite and risk making every day of his presidency about Trump, said the sources, who spoke on background to offer details of private conversations. They said he has specifically told advisers that he is wary of federal tax investigations of Trump or of challenging any orders Trump may issue granting immunity to members of his staff before he leaves office. One adviser said Biden has made it clear that he ‘just wants to move on.'” • Well, that’s what Obama did on torture — “we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards” — and as a result, we have a [x] woman torturer at the head of the CIA! So it’s all good. Biden (D)(2: “Biden COVID-19 adviser: We can get pandemic under control without another national lockdown” [The Hill]. “”The critical parts are understanding what we’ve learned since we did a nationwide lockdown in early April,” [Atul Gawande, a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board] told ABC host Martha Raddatz. ‘And that is that you can have targeted measures building on mask-wearing to include widespread testing, to include dialing up and down capacity restrictions, and those measures need to happen in a more localized basis.'” • I think this translates to no relief, which would make Pelosi’s HEROES Act just a messaging bill, shocking. I would also like to know where what Gawande is suggesting has been tried. Certainly not in Europe. Biden (D)(3): The famous empathy: By coincidence: exactly 6 years ago today, as Vice President of the USA, Joe Biden sent this note to his staff. I presume in the background, thoughts of his first wife & daughter who died long ago; or his son, who died of cancer just a few months after this note. Worth reading. pic.twitter.com/UwBbJ8A73i — dan barker (@danbarker) November 7, 2020 And then we have the Crime Bill, making student debt non-dischargeablein bankruptcy, the vote for the Iraq War, Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, and on and on and on… It seems that the personal really is not the political. Eh? Biden (D)(4): “Judd Gregg: A little, big idea for Biden” [The Hill]. “Over the last years, numerous serious, bipartisan groups have developed constructive and strong plans to fix Social Security. The most recent effort was the proposal put forward by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which was a highly workable and bipartisan plan.” • The Grand Bargain lives!

2020

Trump (R)(1): “US military anticipates Trump will issue order to plan for further troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq” [CNN]. • Oh noes!!!!!! Somebody stop him!!!!!!! UPDATE Meanwhile, there’s always a quote: VP on Afghanistan: "We will leave in 2014." — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 12, 2012 UPDATE Trump (R)(2): “Republicans livid over Trump’s plan to reduce troops in Afghanistan” [Politico]. “‘A rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan now would hurt our allies and delight the people who wish us harm,’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said bluntly.” • Yes, liberal Democrats should definitely let McConnell make the running on this one… Trump (R)(3): “Another shake-up on Trump campaign legal team” [Politico]. “A court filing said Marc Scaringi, a Harrisburg, Pa., attorney, conservative talk radio host and former Senate candidate, was taking over the case. The move came just hours before a potentially make-or-break court hearing scheduled for Tuesday afternoon on motions by Pennsylvania state and county officials to dismiss the lawsuit. The legal escapade devolved into farce on Monday night as the federal judge rejected a move by the campaign to postpone that key hearing. Less than 90 minutes after the outgoing attorneys for the campaign assured U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Brann that ‘Scaringi is aware of the schedule set by the Court in this matter and will be prepared to proceed according to that schedule,’ Scaringi asked the judge to put off the session, arguing that he was inadequately prepared.” • You just can’t get good help these days… * * * “Ossoff, Warnock start Georgia runoffs behind the eight ball” [Politico]. “To repeat Biden’s feat in a pair of Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, with control of the Senate on the line, the Democratic Party will have to defy a long track record of failure in overtime elections. They’ll need to overcome the entire weight of the Republican Party descending on the state — from organizers and operatives to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. One of their Senate candidates, Jon Ossoff, would have to make up the nearly 90,000 votes he ran behind the GOP incumbent on Nov. 3. And Democrats will have to manage all of that without Donald Trump on the ballot to motivate their voters — while Republicans energize their base with warnings that electing Ossoff and Democrat Raphael Warnock would allow liberalism — or even socialism — to run amok in Washington… Democrats have identified thousands of potential new voters they’re working to register, and tens of thousands of volunteers are already mobilizing voters who showed up on Election Day to turn out again.” * * * UPDATE “Aryan Brotherhood Reports Record Surge In Donations On Election Night” [The Topical]. Or in fancier words– “What Joe Biden should say about white supremacy” [Boston Globe]. • It’s hard for me to see how liberal Democrats can keep pushing this line when Trump lost white votes and gained Black and Hispanic votes (unless you want to go into contortions about the oppressed identifying with the oppressor). Still, if they let go, what do they tell the consultants, the HR departments, and the NGOs?

Realignment and Legitimacy

Maybe. What have they got to lose? The path open to the left is to cut the center’s legs out from under it by swaying its voters, many of whom could well be convincible, that the current leadership of the Democratic Party is going to get us all killed. — Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall) November 15, 2020 it will be a neat trick to become the party of the working class without actually empowering them. But maybe the Republicans are feral enough to accomplish it: There's a very strong argument the Republicans will get there first. It's not that the GOP is the party of the working class, it's that at least they know it.

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

Manufacturing: “October 2020 Headline Industrial Production Improves But Remains In Contraction” [Econintersect]. “The headlines say seasonally adjusted Industrial Production (IP) improved month-over-month – but remains deep in contraction year-over-year. Our analysis shows the three-month rolling average improved.”

Imports: “October 2020 Import Year-over-Year Inflation Now -1.0%” [Econintersect]. “Year-over-year import price indices inflation remained in contraction and moved from a revised -1.4 % to -1.0 %. Note from the BLS: ‘U.S. import prices edged down 0.1 percent in October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today, after rising 0.2 percent the previous month. The October decline was driven by lower fuel prices which more than offset higher nonfuel prices. In contrast, prices for U.S. exports increased 0.2 percent in October following a 0.6-percent advance in September.'”

Retail: “Headline Retail Sales Again Improves in October 2020” [Econintersect]. “Retail sales have fully recovered their pre-virus levels overall. However, there is still year-over-year weakness in restaurants, department stores, clothing stores and gas stations. There was a downward adjustment to last month’s data which exaggerated the improvement relative to the previous month. The real test of strength is the rolling averages which modestly improved. Overall, this report is considered no better than last month. Please consider that this data is not adjusted for inflation.”

Housing: “September 2020 CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index Growth Gained Strength, But Still Below Pre-Pandemic Rates” [Econintersect]. “The Single-Family Rent Index (SFRI), which analyzes single-family rent price changes nationally and among 20 metropolitan areas shows a national rent increase of 2.5% year over year, down from a 3% year-over-year increase in September 2019…. The rental market faced a tumultuous journey this year, experiencing the lowest annual growth rate this June for single-family rent prices in 10 years. While national rent prices picked up pace in the late summer, September data shows a divide in recovery across price tiers. Compared to a year ago, lower-priced rentals continued to show declines while higher-priced rentals began to match last year’s growth rates. Those in higher-paying positions that easily transitioned to remote work were able to continue renting in higher price tiers, or even upgrade to new rentals with more space to accommodate working from home. Meanwhile, renters among the lower-priced tier have faced greater job market instability, which by extension has negatively impacted rent price growth.”

Commodities: “Tighter supply and rising demand are lifting prices for some major U.S. farm commodities. Prices for soybeans, corn and hard red winter wheat have risen by about a third since early August… with dry weather, China’s push to fatten its pigs and the lockdown-induced baking bonanza adding to the upward pressure” [Wall Street Journal]. “The shift is among the big swings commodities markets have seen in the past couple of years under strong pivots in domestic and international demand. The biggest impact on supply chains is happening in Asia. China has been restocking grains and rebuilding its hog herds after culling millions of pigs last year to combat an African swine fever outbreak. U.S. regulators predict that China this season will import record volumes of coarse grains, which are mostly corn, and buy more foreign wheat than it has in a quarter-century.”

Marketing: “Khloe Kardashian sparks backlash for ‘unethical’ promotion of expensive ‘Big Pharma’ drugs” [Independent]. “Last week, Kardashian tweeted about a sponsored deal with the pharmaceutical company Biohaven for their newly-launched migraine medication NurtecODT, saying that she “dared to reimagine life with #migraine”. She encouraged fans to ask their doctors about the drug and visit the company’s website…. Some also noted the medication is extortionately expensive, costing between $897 and over $1,000 for a package of eight doses without insurance (according to a 2018 census, 27.5 million Americans do not have health insurance).”

Shipping: “Vaccine hope but multiple solutions needed to resolve crew change crisis” [Hellenic Shipping News]. “The availability of COVID-19 vaccines and rapid, standardised testing for the virus could be crucial in helping to resolve the ongoing crew change crisis. However, a meeting of a cross section of UN agencies, shipping organizations, unions and maritime and logistics businesses, agreed that the focus needs to be on developing a range of practical solutions. Some 400,000 seafarers are stuck at sea, months beyond their contracted time, with increasing reports of severe fatigue and mental distress. A similar number of seafarers are trying to join ships to begin contracts, but transit to and from ships is being thwarted by travel restrictions and limitations imposed due to the pandemic. The roundtable meeting (13 November), hosted by IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim, provided an opportunity for a frank exchange of ideas on how to move forward. Among the proposals discussed were further pushes to implement public health corridors, regional implementation of protocols to allow ports/airports to facilitate crew changes and the concept of a tamper-proof digital health passport or certificate for seafarers.” • A “frank exchange of ideas”… Yikes! On the crew change crisis, see NC here. In September, there were 300,000 “stranded seafarers.” Now there are 400,000. Yikes again.

Tech: “Apple’s New MacBook Pro Fights Three Crucial Issues” [Forbes]. • Worth a read if you’re in the market for a Mac; it seems that Apple does want my business as a professional after all, since not only is the machine faster, they didn’t crap around with the form factor for marketing churn. (To Apple’s credit, they ditched the butterfly credit. Now, they should bring back the MagSafe connector.) The article comments: “It’s the software that needs to be put through the wringer.” And that Apple is sucking up my identity and location whenever I open an app… That’s a problem that needs to go away.

Health Care

Please read these two in combination:

“The Exit Polls Show The Need To Confront COVID-19 Denial in Red America ” [Drew Altman, Kaiser Family Foundation] (Altman). “Exit polls show that when President Trump accused Democrats of exaggerating the gravity of the COVID -19 pandemic his supporters believed him. Trump supporters showed as they voted that they don’t see COVID-19 as a very urgent problem. It leaves the Biden administration with a massive public re-education challenge in red America and among Trump supporters in every state. This matters because COVID-19 is surging and it will be exceedingly difficult to get a handle on the pandemic as long as half the adult population – the folks who followed Trump – are COVID-19 deniers and dissenters . We are also on the verge of seeing a vaccine become a reality. People who don’t believe COVID-19 is a serious threat will likely feel less compelled to get a vaccine. Over decades of messaging about HIV testing and treatment in our Greater Than AIDS program we have learned that there is no one-size-fits-all message. Messages need to be targeted to be effective with different groups. That means heavy use of digital media not PSA’s on television. And messengers have to be credible not just famous. Real people and real life stories ring true. Messages that direct people to local resources or actions they can take to protect themselves and their families are often most effective. An important challenge is to emphasize disproportionate impact on people of color without furthering stigma or marginalization. The Biden administration will need to convince the deniers that COVID-19 and the economy are not an either or, and that getting a handle on COVID-19 is the route to building the economy. As Trump fades from the presidency more Americans who see COVID-19 denial as fealty to Trump may come around.” • This is a schizphrenic post. On the one hand, yes, from the AIDS crisis, “there is no one-size-fits-all message.” On the other, the phrases I have helpfully underlines are not conducive to persuasion, starting from the notion and that Red States need to be educated by Blue States — where New York and California hardly have the standing to lecture others — and moving on from there. (See NC here on vaccine uptake and persuasion by experts.) And now this amazing screed–

“Olbermann vs Trump #25: 11/10 – We’re not getting what we’re paying for” [Daily Kos]. Olbermann: “Without the money the financially successful blue states give them, the red states would starve. Just six of these enclaves of minority oppression cost us a net $200 Billion a year… You want to talk about eliminating the electoral college? Correcting the Supreme Court? Reducing the mini-states’ representation in the Senate? Then maybe we can continue to fund the states that can’t carry their own weight, like Florida and Texas and the rest. (If you’d like to see just how much your state is subsidizing the loser states – or how much each of them sucks out of the taxpayer wallet: https://www.businessinsider.com/feder…) Oh by the way, isn’t taking money from the hard-working people of a successful state, to give it to the slackers and lazy thugs of the failed states… SOCIALISM?” • First, does anybody think that people who live in Red States haven’t heard the same message from Olbermann and his ilk many times before? And will that message make it easier to persuade “folks who followed Trump,” or not? Second, consider the morality of it. Olbermann wants to cut off Federal funding for all the children in Red States who need it, as well as all the Democrats in Red States who worked so hard to drag his moribund candidate over the finish line. Check out the comments section on the original YouTube, which I couldn’t bear to link to. “Folks” are cheering Olbermann on….

“The Great Revenge – How Tony Fauci F*cked Donald Trump” [Moon of Alabama]. I don’t think this got enough attention in this morning’s Links, so I am re-upping it here; it’s well worth reading in full. The two key sentences: “In October two leading vaccine companies were ready to announce the success of their vaccine trials. But with at least the knowledge of Fauci and the Federal Drug Administration both companies deviated from their clinical protocols to intentionally move their success announcement to a date after the election.” And: “In October two leading vaccine companies were ready to announce the success of their vaccine trials. But with at least the knowledge of Fauci and the Federal Drug Administration both companies deviated from their clinical protocols to intentionally move their success announcement to a date after the election.” • The effect, of course, was to deny Trump an “October Surprise” on vaccines. If this is true — and I would like expert readers to examine the protocols that MoA quotes carefully, because that is above my pay-grade — it would be quite remarkable; after all, the number of deaths resulting from a delaying the announcement of a vaccine, which would initiate a cascade of follow-on events, could surely be calculated to an order of magnitude. On the personal level, much would depend on the character of Fauci, who (a) has admitted that he told a “noble lie” to the general population on masks, and (b) ramped Gilead’s stock, and Pfizer’s too, based on press releases. From 30,000 feet, all this is entirely consistent with the PMC having come to class consciousness in ithe period 2016-2020. Also, if this is true, Biden owes Fauci rather a lot.

“Covid-19: As lab execs sell shares worth millions, questions arise” [Medical Express]. “Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax: executives at several American laboratories developing COVID-19 vaccines have recently pocketed millions of dollars by selling shares in their companies—raising questions about the propriety of such a move in the midst of a national health crisis. On the very day that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced preliminary data showing its vaccine was 90 percent effective against the coronavirus, its chief executive Albert Bourla sold shares worth $5.6 million…. Under the same rules, several Moderna officials have sold shares worth more than $100 million in recent months. That company has not placed a single product on the market since its creation in 2010, but the federal government has committed to paying it up to $2.5 billion if its vaccine proves effective…. Executives at Pfizer and Moderna were operating under a rule put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to allow company employees to sell shares without facing insider-trading charges…. It allows them to set up a plan determining the trades of their shares at a price, amount or dates specified in advance, but only when they are not in possession of privileged information that could affect share prices. Once such a sale is planned, it cannot be modified at the last minute, even if its timing might ultimately raise questions. Still, this use of the rule by Pfizer and Moderna appears ‘legally questionable,’ according to Daniel Taylor, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school, who has been studying the big pharma firms since the beginning of the pandemic. ‘ The question is, what did the executives know at the time that they pre-scheduled the trade ?’ he asked.” • See above….

“In Wyoming, a Covid-19 surge, a struggling energy economy and a thriving haven for the rich” [NBC]. “For the rich, Wyoming embodies escape, from both the pandemic and other problems, where open skies and empty pastures can help you clear your mind. As states locked down, Wyoming stayed open. ‘We have been socially distancing the entire 130 years that we have been a state,’ Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said on ‘Fox & Friends’ in April, explaining why Wyoming hadn’t issued a stay-at-home order. The wealthy had already shown up by then, and the way they continue to experience the pandemic looks very different from the experiences of most others in the state. Covid-19, in Wyoming and elsewhere throughout the country, has laid the disparities bare. If you live on a multimillion-dollar ranch in Jackson Hole, you have access to private doctors. You might have even brought your own ventilator when you fled to the state, [said Justin Farrell, a sociology professor at Yale University and author of the book ‘Billionaire Wilderness’] said. But elsewhere in the state, where there are only about 5 people per square mile, residents are left vulnerable to the labor market and broadly lack access to health care. Populations are older and more health-compromised on average, and many people live far from clinics. uxury retreats like Jackson Hole translate into more money spent in the community, sure, but the elites who move to Wyoming, which has no income tax, are often doing so to shelter from taxes.” • I can think of other ways to “clear your mind”….

Class Warfare

“An Update on Employment changes by employer size during the COVID-19pandemic: a look at the Current Employment Statistics survey microdata” (PDF) [Bureau of Labor Statistics]. “ontinuing trends observed since mid-summer, we observe continued faster job recovery among large employers than among smaller employers. Within small employers, we also find that in October 2020, for the first time since March, job losses due to the closure of establishments were greater than job losses in employers that continued employing at least one person.” • I’m sure readers will have seen this play out….

“Social Unrest Is the Inevitable Legacy of the Covid Pandemic” [Bloomberg]. “‘So when our Sickness, and our Poverty Had greater wants than we could well supply; Strict Orders did but more enrage our grief, And hinder in accomplishing relief.’ That’s how the British poet George Wither explained a spreading rebellion against social-distancing rules. Seeing quarantines and lockdowns as unfair and tyrannical punishments, people were taking to the streets. The year was 1625, the place was London, the disease was plague…. In March, still early in the pandemic, think tankers were already noticing that we were entering an “age of mass protests” — the number of uprisings globally has been increasing by an average of 11.5% a year since 2009. Covid-19, like so many other plagues before, will now act as the fire accelerant. Some upheavals will topple governments, others will be repressed. Some will flare up soon, others will smolder for years. In 1381, the rural poor of England rose up in the so-called Peasants’ Revolt, killing, looting and burning. They did so because their lives had become unlivable since the Black Death first came ashore 33 years earlier. And the elites had done nothing in that time to make things better.”

“Fender CEO: We’re ‘running at full tilt’ amid record demand” [Yahoo Finance]. “Although the coronavirus pandemic has devastated many small businesses, companies like guitar maker Fender have managed to not just hold on, but thrive. ‘When the lockdowns went and took place in March, I never would have predicted in my wildest dreams that the company was going to end up having a record year,’ Fender CEO Andy Mooney told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ‘But in fact, that’s what’s going to happen. We’re literally running at full tilt to keep pace with demand through the end of this year and the beginning of next.’ The surprise upside during recession times that Mooney described isn’t entirely unexpected. Last year around the same time, he told Yahoo Finance that he believed the company was ‘recession-resistant.’… Stay-at-home orders, which forced many Americans into quarantine or isolation, was a pivotal moment for Fender. ‘People really used their time to invest in themselves, learning how to play a musical instrument, a guitar in particular, seemed to be near the top of their list,’ Mooney explained.” • I wonder if the same logic works for, say, Marshall amps.

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord

Election Legitimacy

The 2016 material below happened on December 14-16, right after I wrote “Federalist 68, the Electoral College, and Faithless Electors” on December 13, in which (see the final paragraphs) I was far too polite to use the word “coup.” (I went digging after I listened to the currentThe West Wing Thing podcast, “Swiss Diplomacy“, where they also quote the passage from Shattered where Podesta and Mook call a meeting in Brooklyn and decide to pin the loss on the Russians.) I missed it because I don’t watch television. “Celebrities are urging the Electoral College not to vote for Trump” [Business Insider]. “As part of a last-ditch effort to block Donald Trump from becoming the next US president, a host of celebrities appear in a PSA encouraging members of the Electoral College not to cast their vote for the president-elect. ‘The West Wing’ star Martin Sheen starts the Unite for America-sponsored pitch to the Republican members of the Electoral College.” • Oy. (“Unite for America”‘s website is dead, and it was made with SquareSpace, so it looks like a throwaway. But I don’t know which liberal Democrat pseudopodium funded the PSA. This article has what seems to be a proto-Great Assimilation™ Crew in the bio section: “Jon Gedney is a national organizer for Unite for America, Ryan Clayton is president of Americans Take Action, Chris Suprun was a 2016 presidential elector for the state of Texas, Michael Baca is the co-founder of the Hamilton Electors and Tom Hancock, PhD is a national grass roots organizer for the New Conservative Movement.” “National organizer for a thing with a dead website four years later. Oh… kay.) Here is the video: So all this liberal Democrat frothing and stamping about denying election legitimacy? Purest projection, from people who either have the memory of goldfish or are completely disingenuous. Or both! I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. And speaking of projection: ROUND OF APPLAUSE as we welcome Harvard Prof. Lawrence Lessig to today's episode of… How it started ….

Biden Transition

Biden (D)(1): “Biden hopes to avoid divisive Trump investigations, preferring unity” [NBC]. “President-elect Joe Biden has privately told advisers that he doesn’t want his presidency to be consumed by investigations of his predecessor, according to five people familiar with the discussions, despite pressure from some Democrats who want inquiries into President Donald Trump, his policies and members of his administration. Biden has raised concerns that investigations would further divide a country he is trying to unite and risk making every day of his presidency about Trump, said the sources, who spoke on background to offer details of private conversations. They said he has specifically told advisers that he is wary of federal tax investigations of Trump or of challenging any orders Trump may issue granting immunity to members of his staff before he leaves office. One adviser said Biden has made it clear that he ‘just wants to move on.'” • Well, that’s what Obama did on torture — “we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards” — and as a result, we have a [x] woman torturer at the head of the CIA! So it’s all good. Biden (D)(2: “Biden COVID-19 adviser: We can get pandemic under control without another national lockdown” [The Hill]. “”The critical parts are understanding what we’ve learned since we did a nationwide lockdown in early April,” [Atul Gawande, a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board] told ABC host Martha Raddatz. ‘And that is that you can have targeted measures building on mask-wearing to include widespread testing, to include dialing up and down capacity restrictions, and those measures need to happen in a more localized basis.'” • I think this translates to no relief, which would make Pelosi’s HEROES Act just a messaging bill, shocking. I would also like to know where what Gawande is suggesting has been tried. Certainly not in Europe. Biden (D)(3): The famous empathy: By coincidence: exactly 6 years ago today, as Vice President of the USA, Joe Biden sent this note to his staff. I presume in the background, thoughts of his first wife & daughter who died long ago; or his son, who died of cancer just a few months after this note. Worth reading. pic.twitter.com/UwBbJ8A73i — dan barker (@danbarker) November 7, 2020 And then we have the Crime Bill, making student debt non-dischargeablein bankruptcy, the vote for the Iraq War, Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, and on and on and on… It seems that the personal really is not the political. Eh? Biden (D)(4): “Judd Gregg: A little, big idea for Biden” [The Hill]. “Over the last years, numerous serious, bipartisan groups have developed constructive and strong plans to fix Social Security. The most recent effort was the proposal put forward by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which was a highly workable and bipartisan plan.” • The Grand Bargain lives!

2020

Trump (R)(1): “US military anticipates Trump will issue order to plan for further troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq” [CNN]. • Oh noes!!!!!! Somebody stop him!!!!!!! UPDATE Meanwhile, there’s always a quote: VP on Afghanistan: "We will leave in 2014." — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 12, 2012 UPDATE Trump (R)(2): “Republicans livid over Trump’s plan to reduce troops in Afghanistan” [Politico]. “‘A rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan now would hurt our allies and delight the people who wish us harm,’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said bluntly.” • Yes, liberal Democrats should definitely let McConnell make the running on this one… Trump (R)(3): “Another shake-up on Trump campaign legal team” [Politico]. “A court filing said Marc Scaringi, a Harrisburg, Pa., attorney, conservative talk radio host and former Senate candidate, was taking over the case. The move came just hours before a potentially make-or-break court hearing scheduled for Tuesday afternoon on motions by Pennsylvania state and county officials to dismiss the lawsuit. The legal escapade devolved into farce on Monday night as the federal judge rejected a move by the campaign to postpone that key hearing. Less than 90 minutes after the outgoing attorneys for the campaign assured U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Brann that ‘Scaringi is aware of the schedule set by the Court in this matter and will be prepared to proceed according to that schedule,’ Scaringi asked the judge to put off the session, arguing that he was inadequately prepared.” • You just can’t get good help these days… * * * “Ossoff, Warnock start Georgia runoffs behind the eight ball” [Politico]. “To repeat Biden’s feat in a pair of Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, with control of the Senate on the line, the Democratic Party will have to defy a long track record of failure in overtime elections. They’ll need to overcome the entire weight of the Republican Party descending on the state — from organizers and operatives to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. One of their Senate candidates, Jon Ossoff, would have to make up the nearly 90,000 votes he ran behind the GOP incumbent on Nov. 3. And Democrats will have to manage all of that without Donald Trump on the ballot to motivate their voters — while Republicans energize their base with warnings that electing Ossoff and Democrat Raphael Warnock would allow liberalism — or even socialism — to run amok in Washington… Democrats have identified thousands of potential new voters they’re working to register, and tens of thousands of volunteers are already mobilizing voters who showed up on Election Day to turn out again.” * * * UPDATE “Aryan Brotherhood Reports Record Surge In Donations On Election Night” [The Topical]. Or in fancier words– “What Joe Biden should say about white supremacy” [Boston Globe]. • It’s hard for me to see how liberal Democrats can keep pushing this line when Trump lost white votes and gained Black and Hispanic votes (unless you want to go into contortions about the oppressed identifying with the oppressor). Still, if they let go, what do they tell the consultants, the HR departments, and the NGOs?

Realignment and Legitimacy

Maybe. What have they got to lose? The path open to the left is to cut the center’s legs out from under it by swaying its voters, many of whom could well be convincible, that the current leadership of the Democratic Party is going to get us all killed. — Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall) November 15, 2020 it will be a neat trick to become the party of the working class without actually empowering them. But maybe the Republicans are feral enough to accomplish it: There's a very strong argument the Republicans will get there first. It's not that the GOP is the party of the working class, it's that at least they know it. Progressives and Democrats actually do not understand they outsourced most stuff and gave the keys to the rest to Google. https://t.co/B2jjQjVgyT — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) November 15, 2020

Stats Watch

At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they’re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.

Manufacturing: “October 2020 Headline Industrial Production Improves But Remains In Contraction” [Econintersect]. “The headlines say seasonally adjusted Industrial Production (IP) improved month-over-month – but remains deep in contraction year-over-year. Our analysis shows the three-month rolling average improved.”

Imports: “October 2020 Import Year-over-Year Inflation Now -1.0%” [Econintersect]. “Year-over-year import price indices inflation remained in contraction and moved from a revised -1.4 % to -1.0 %. Note from the BLS: ‘U.S. import prices edged down 0.1 percent in October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today, after rising 0.2 percent the previous month. The October decline was driven by lower fuel prices which more than offset higher nonfuel prices. In contrast, prices for U.S. exports increased 0.2 percent in October following a 0.6-percent advance in September.'”

Retail: “Headline Retail Sales Again Improves in October 2020” [Econintersect]. “Retail sales have fully recovered their pre-virus levels overall. However, there is still year-over-year weakness in restaurants, department stores, clothing stores and gas stations. There was a downward adjustment to last month’s data which exaggerated the improvement relative to the previous month. The real test of strength is the rolling averages which modestly improved. Overall, this report is considered no better than last month. Please consider that this data is not adjusted for inflation.”

Housing: “September 2020 CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index Growth Gained Strength, But Still Below Pre-Pandemic Rates” [Econintersect]. “The Single-Family Rent Index (SFRI), which analyzes single-family rent price changes nationally and among 20 metropolitan areas shows a national rent increase of 2.5% year over year, down from a 3% year-over-year increase in September 2019…. The rental market faced a tumultuous journey this year, experiencing the lowest annual growth rate this June for single-family rent prices in 10 years. While national rent prices picked up pace in the late summer, September data shows a divide in recovery across price tiers. Compared to a year ago, lower-priced rentals continued to show declines while higher-priced rentals began to match last year’s growth rates. Those in higher-paying positions that easily transitioned to remote work were able to continue renting in higher price tiers, or even upgrade to new rentals with more space to accommodate working from home. Meanwhile, renters among the lower-priced tier have faced greater job market instability, which by extension has negatively impacted rent price growth.”

Commodities: “Tighter supply and rising demand are lifting prices for some major U.S. farm commodities. Prices for soybeans, corn and hard red winter wheat have risen by about a third since early August… with dry weather, China’s push to fatten its pigs and the lockdown-induced baking bonanza adding to the upward pressure” [Wall Street Journal]. “The shift is among the big swings commodities markets have seen in the past couple of years under strong pivots in domestic and international demand. The biggest impact on supply chains is happening in Asia. China has been restocking grains and rebuilding its hog herds after culling millions of pigs last year to combat an African swine fever outbreak. U.S. regulators predict that China this season will import record volumes of coarse grains, which are mostly corn, and buy more foreign wheat than it has in a quarter-century.”

Marketing: “Khloe Kardashian sparks backlash for ‘unethical’ promotion of expensive ‘Big Pharma’ drugs” [Independent]. “Last week, Kardashian tweeted about a sponsored deal with the pharmaceutical company Biohaven for their newly-launched migraine medication NurtecODT, saying that she “dared to reimagine life with #migraine”. She encouraged fans to ask their doctors about the drug and visit the company’s website…. Some also noted the medication is extortionately expensive, costing between $897 and over $1,000 for a package of eight doses without insurance (according to a 2018 census, 27.5 million Americans do not have health insurance).”

Shipping: “Vaccine hope but multiple solutions needed to resolve crew change crisis” [Hellenic Shipping News]. “The availability of COVID-19 vaccines and rapid, standardised testing for the virus could be crucial in helping to resolve the ongoing crew change crisis. However, a meeting of a cross section of UN agencies, shipping organizations, unions and maritime and logistics businesses, agreed that the focus needs to be on developing a range of practical solutions. Some 400,000 seafarers are stuck at sea, months beyond their contracted time, with increasing reports of severe fatigue and mental distress. A similar number of seafarers are trying to join ships to begin contracts, but transit to and from ships is being thwarted by travel restrictions and limitations imposed due to the pandemic. The roundtable meeting (13 November), hosted by IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim, provided an opportunity for a frank exchange of ideas on how to move forward. Among the proposals discussed were further pushes to implement public health corridors, regional implementation of protocols to allow ports/airports to facilitate crew changes and the concept of a tamper-proof digital health passport or certificate for seafarers.” • A “frank exchange of ideas”… Yikes! On the crew change crisis, see NC here. In September, there were 300,000 “stranded seafarers.” Now there are 400,000. Yikes again.

Tech: “Apple’s New MacBook Pro Fights Three Crucial Issues” [Forbes]. • Worth a read if you’re in the market for a Mac; it seems that Apple does want my business as a professional after all, since not only is the machine faster, they didn’t crap around with the form factor for marketing churn. (To Apple’s credit, they ditched the butterfly credit. Now, they should bring back the MagSafe connector.) The article comments: “It’s the software that needs to be put through the wringer.” And that Apple is sucking up my identity and location whenever I open an app… That’s a problem that needs to go away.

Health Care

Please read these two in combination:

“The Exit Polls Show The Need To Confront COVID-19 Denial in Red America ” [Drew Altman, Kaiser Family Foundation] (Altman). “Exit polls show that when President Trump accused Democrats of exaggerating the gravity of the COVID -19 pandemic his supporters believed him. Trump supporters showed as they voted that they don’t see COVID-19 as a very urgent problem. It leaves the Biden administration with a massive public re-education challenge in red America and among Trump supporters in every state. This matters because COVID-19 is surging and it will be exceedingly difficult to get a handle on the pandemic as long as half the adult population – the folks who followed Trump – are COVID-19 deniers and dissenters . We are also on the verge of seeing a vaccine become a reality. People who don’t believe COVID-19 is a serious threat will likely feel less compelled to get a vaccine. Over decades of messaging about HIV testing and treatment in our Greater Than AIDS program we have learned that there is no one-size-fits-all message. Messages need to be targeted to be effective with different groups. That means heavy use of digital media not PSA’s on television. And messengers have to be credible not just famous. Real people and real life stories ring true. Messages that direct people to local resources or actions they can take to protect themselves and their families are often most effective. An important challenge is to emphasize disproportionate impact on people of color without furthering stigma or marginalization. The Biden administration will need to convince the deniers that COVID-19 and the economy are not an either or, and that getting a handle on COVID-19 is the route to building the economy. As Trump fades from the presidency more Americans who see COVID-19 denial as fealty to Trump may come around.” • This is a schizphrenic post. On the one hand, yes, from the AIDS crisis, “there is no one-size-fits-all message.” On the other, the phrases I have helpfully underlines are not conducive to persuasion, starting from the notion and that Red States need to be educated by Blue States — where New York and California hardly have the standing to lecture others — and moving on from there. (See NC here on vaccine uptake and persuasion by experts.) And now this amazing screed–

“Olbermann vs Trump #25: 11/10 – We’re not getting what we’re paying for” [Daily Kos]. Olbermann: “Without the money the financially successful blue states give them, the red states would starve. Just six of these enclaves of minority oppression cost us a net $200 Billion a year… You want to talk about eliminating the electoral college? Correcting the Supreme Court? Reducing the mini-states’ representation in the Senate? Then maybe we can continue to fund the states that can’t carry their own weight, like Florida and Texas and the rest. (If you’d like to see just how much your state is subsidizing the loser states – or how much each of them sucks out of the taxpayer wallet: https://www.businessinsider.com/feder…) Oh by the way, isn’t taking money from the hard-working people of a successful state, to give it to the slackers and lazy thugs of the failed states… SOCIALISM?” • First, does anybody think that people who live in Red States haven’t heard the same message from Olbermann and his ilk many times before? And will that message make it easier to persuade “folks who followed Trump,” or not? Second, consider the morality of it. Olbermann wants to cut off Federal funding for all the children in Red States who need it, as well as all the Democrats in Red States who worked so hard to drag his moribund candidate over the finish line. Check out the comments section on the original YouTube, which I couldn’t bear to link to. “Folks” are cheering Olbermann on….

“The Great Revenge – How Tony Fauci F*cked Donald Trump” [Moon of Alabama]. I don’t think this got enough attention in this morning’s Links, so I am re-upping it here; it’s well worth reading in full. The two key sentences: “In October two leading vaccine companies were ready to announce the success of their vaccine trials. But with at least the knowledge of Fauci and the Federal Drug Administration both companies deviated from their clinical protocols to intentionally move their success announcement to a date after the election.” And: “In October two leading vaccine companies were ready to announce the success of their vaccine trials. But with at least the knowledge of Fauci and the Federal Drug Administration both companies deviated from their clinical protocols to intentionally move their success announcement to a date after the election.” • The effect, of course, was to deny Trump an “October Surprise” on vaccines. If this is true — and I would like expert readers to examine the protocols that MoA quotes carefully, because that is above my pay-grade — it would be quite remarkable; after all, the number of deaths resulting from a delaying the announcement of a vaccine, which would initiate a cascade of follow-on events, could surely be calculated to an order of magnitude. On the personal level, much would depend on the character of Fauci, who (a) has admitted that he told a “noble lie” to the general population on masks, and (b) ramped Gilead’s stock, and Pfizer’s too, based on press releases. From 30,000 feet, all this is entirely consistent with the PMC having come to class consciousness in ithe period 2016-2020. Also, if this is true, Biden owes Fauci rather a lot.

“Covid-19: As lab execs sell shares worth millions, questions arise” [Medical Express]. “Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax: executives at several American laboratories developing COVID-19 vaccines have recently pocketed millions of dollars by selling shares in their companies—raising questions about the propriety of such a move in the midst of a national health crisis. On the very day that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced preliminary data showing its vaccine was 90 percent effective against the coronavirus, its chief executive Albert Bourla sold shares worth $5.6 million…. Under the same rules, several Moderna officials have sold shares worth more than $100 million in recent months. That company has not placed a single product on the market since its creation in 2010, but the federal government has committed to paying it up to $2.5 billion if its vaccine proves effective…. Executives at Pfizer and Moderna were operating under a rule put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to allow company employees to sell shares without facing insider-trading charges…. It allows them to set up a plan determining the trades of their shares at a price, amount or dates specified in advance, but only when they are not in possession of privileged information that could affect share prices. Once such a sale is planned, it cannot be modified at the last minute, even if its timing might ultimately raise questions. Still, this use of the rule by Pfizer and Moderna appears ‘legally questionable,’ according to Daniel Taylor, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school, who has been studying the big pharma firms since the beginning of the pandemic. ‘ The question is, what did the executives know at the time that they pre-scheduled the trade ?’ he asked.” • See above….

“In Wyoming, a Covid-19 surge, a struggling energy economy and a thriving haven for the rich” [NBC]. “For the rich, Wyoming embodies escape, from both the pandemic and other problems, where open skies and empty pastures can help you clear your mind. As states locked down, Wyoming stayed open. ‘We have been socially distancing the entire 130 years that we have been a state,’ Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said on ‘Fox & Friends’ in April, explaining why Wyoming hadn’t issued a stay-at-home order. The wealthy had already shown up by then, and the way they continue to experience the pandemic looks very different from the experiences of most others in the state. Covid-19, in Wyoming and elsewhere throughout the country, has laid the disparities bare. If you live on a multimillion-dollar ranch in Jackson Hole, you have access to private doctors. You might have even brought your own ventilator when you fled to the state, [said Justin Farrell, a sociology professor at Yale University and author of the book ‘Billionaire Wilderness’] said. But elsewhere in the state, where there are only about 5 people per square mile, residents are left vulnerable to the labor market and broadly lack access to health care. Populations are older and more health-compromised on average, and many people live far from clinics. uxury retreats like Jackson Hole translate into more money spent in the community, sure, but the elites who move to Wyoming, which has no income tax, are often doing so to shelter from taxes.” • I can think of other ways to “clear your mind”….

Class Warfare

“An Update on Employment changes by employer size during the COVID-19pandemic: a look at the Current Employment Statistics survey microdata” (PDF) [Bureau of Labor Statistics]. “ontinuing trends observed since mid-summer, we observe continued faster job recovery among large employers than among smaller employers. Within small employers, we also find that in October 2020, for the first time since March, job losses due to the closure of establishments were greater than job losses in employers that continued employing at least one person.” • I’m sure readers will have seen this play out….

“Social Unrest Is the Inevitable Legacy of the Covid Pandemic” [Bloomberg]. “‘So when our Sickness, and our Poverty Had greater wants than we could well supply; Strict Orders did but more enrage our grief, And hinder in accomplishing relief.’ That’s how the British poet George Wither explained a spreading rebellion against social-distancing rules. Seeing quarantines and lockdowns as unfair and tyrannical punishments, people were taking to the streets. The year was 1625, the place was London, the disease was plague…. In March, still early in the pandemic, think tankers were already noticing that we were entering an “age of mass protests” — the number of uprisings globally has been increasing by an average of 11.5% a year since 2009. Covid-19, like so many other plagues before, will now act as the fire accelerant. Some upheavals will topple governments, others will be repressed. Some will flare up soon, others will smolder for years. In 1381, the rural poor of England rose up in the so-called Peasants’ Revolt, killing, looting and burning. They did so because their lives had become unlivable since the Black Death first came ashore 33 years earlier. And the elites had done nothing in that time to make things better.”

News of the Wired

“Fender CEO: We’re ‘running at full tilt’ amid record demand” [Yahoo Finance]. “Although the coronavirus pandemic has devastated many small businesses, companies like guitar maker Fender have managed to not just hold on, but thrive. ‘When the lockdowns went and took place in March, I never would have predicted in my wildest dreams that the company was going to end up having a record year,’ Fender CEO Andy Mooney told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ‘But in fact, that’s what’s going to happen. We’re literally running at full tilt to keep pace with demand through the end of this year and the beginning of next.’ The surprise upside during recession times that Mooney described isn’t entirely unexpected. Last year around the same time, he told Yahoo Finance that he believed the company was ‘recession-resistant.’… Stay-at-home orders, which forced many Americans into quarantine or isolation, was a pivotal moment for Fender. ‘People really used their time to invest in themselves, learning how to play a musical instrument, a guitar in particular, seemed to be near the top of their list,’ Mooney explained.” • I wonder if the same logic works for, say, Marshall amps.

Pfizer says vaccine 95% effective, will seek FDA's okay "within days"It's the latest hopeful news for a world desperate to turn the tide on the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people globally, and almost 250,000 in the U.S. alone.Pfizer said Wednesday that a final assessment of trial data on the COVID-19 vaccine it developed in conjunction with German company BioNTech showed it was 95% effective, and that it would apply for emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration "within days." It was the latest hopeful news for a world desperate to turn the tide on the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people globally, and almost 250,000 in the U.S. alone.

In a statement released early Wednesday, Pfizer said the efficacy of its vaccine was consistent "across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics," and that trial data after two months had met the criteria laid out by the FDA to demonstrate both the safety and function of the vaccine.

"Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit a request within days to the FDA for an EUA [Emergency Use Authorization] based on the totality of safety and efficacy data collected to date," the U.S. pharmaceuticals giant said.

BREAKING: We are proud to announce, along with @BioNTech_Group, that the Phase 3 study of our #COVID19 vaccine candidate has met all primary efficacy endpoints. — Pfizer Inc. (@pfizer) November 18, 2020

Pfizer became the first vaccine maker to claim an extremely high efficacy for its formula last week, saying preliminary data showed it to be more than 90% effective at preventing new coronavirus infections. Wednesday's announcement cemented those results with final data, and made them even more optimistic by matching preliminary efficacy data reported by Moderna, another American vaccine maker that hopes to seek EUA in the U.S. soon.

Pfizer said the Phase 3 human trials, which involved more than 43,000 people, showed the vaccine "was well tolerated across all populations," with "no serious safety concerns observed." The only notable side effects, according to Pfizer, were fatigue in 3.8% of vaccine recipients and headaches in about 2%.

If approved for use by the FDA, the Pfizer vaccine will require patients to get two shots, the second one coming 21 days after the first.

Both Pfizer and, in theory, Moderna could get emergency approval from the FDA in short order, but only after the drugmakers manage to ship millions of doses around the world can widespread vaccination efforts begin in earnest. And with the Pfizer vaccine in particular, that poses significant challenges.

Pfizer's vaccine must be kept at almost 100 degrees below zero Fahrenheit to remain effective. That's about 20 degrees colder than extreme winter temperatures at the South Pole. Early on, experts warned that the U.S. lacked the necessary ultra-cold storage trucks and cargo planes needed to ship hundreds of millions of doses at sub-sub-zero temperatures.

To get around that, Pfizer has developed specially built deep-freeze "suitcases" that can be tightly sealed and shipped even in non-refrigerated trucks. But while Pfizer may have solved the problem of how to ship the frozen vaccine, these highly engineered shipping containers create other problems, particularly for the hospitals, pharmacies and outpatient clinics that will have to administer the vaccinations to hundreds of millions of Americans.

"The reality is there has never been been a drug that required storage at this temperature," said Soumi Saha, a pharmacist and director of advocacy at Premier, which acts as a purchasing agent for hospitals across the country. "The administration and distribution effort will require an all hands on deck."

Game change. This is a great day for patients as Pfizer (where I serve on the BoD) announces final top line results from the phase 3 trial with its Covid-19 vaccine. We should now have two vaccines that could effectively end the U.S. epidemic next year if everything goes right. https://t.co/ieQwYywD97 — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) November 18, 2020

Despite those challenges, the latest news from Pfizer was likely to be welcomed by the medical and scientific community. Former FDA administrator Scott Gottlieb called the result a "game change" in a tweet early Wednesday.

"We should now have two vaccines that could effectively end the U.S. epidemic next year if everything goes right," Gottlieb, who serves on Pfizer's board of directors, said, referring to both Pfizer's and Moderna's positive results.

While the U.S. government has poured billions of taxpayer dollars into helping develop a number of "candidate" vaccines still in undergoing trials around the world, Pfizer's management decided not to accept any government funding to develop it's drug.

CEO Albert Bourla said he "wanted to liberate our scientists from any bureaucracy... When you get money from someone, that always comes with strings."

Pfizer did strike a large-scale production and delivery deal with the U.S. government, however, worth up to $1.95 billion, to secure an initial 100 million doses of the vaccine once its approved, with the option to purchase 500 million more, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Pfizer says trials show its COVID vaccine "more than 90% effective""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis," Pfizer CEO says.London — U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said Monday that human trials suggest its coronavirus vaccine is 90% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections in people not known to have had the virus already. The pharmaceutical giant said it would be applying for Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA as soon as final data meets safety milestones, which it expects to happen in the third week of November.

"Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine's ability to prevent COVID-19," Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

"We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen. With today's news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis," he continued.

If approved, the vaccine will require patients to receive two shots, with the second coming 21 days after the first.

"We know it's a two-dose vaccine, so we want to ensure that we can manage the — the delivery of the first dose and ensure the delivery of the second dose — while we simultaneously integrate new rounds of doses being delivered to the American people," General Gus Perna, leader of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government's program to inoculate 300 million Americans against the coronavirus by next spring, told "60 Minutes" on Sunday.

Perna said Operation Warp Speed is ready to begin distributing the Pfizer vaccine around the U.S., along with kits of the needles, syringes and alcohol swabs, as soon as it receives federal approval, with doses already stockpiled.

"It's a simple command of, 'Execute,'" he told "60 Minutes."

Pfizer is one of several companies with a vaccine candidate in phase three trials, and it is the only U.S.-based pharmaceutical company to have rejected government funding for the development of its coronavirus vaccine. Bourla said he wanted to shield the pharmaceutical giant from politics.

"I wanted to liberate our scientists from any bureaucracy," he said. "When you get money from someone, that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. I didn't want to have any of that. I wanted them — basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics," he said.

Pfizer did, however, strike a large-scale production and delivery deal with the U.S. government, worth up to $1.95 billion, to secure an initial 100 million doses of its vaccine, following its approval, and the option to purchase 500 million more, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

There will be some obstacles to delivery. Unlike some of the other vaccines in the works, the Pfizer cocktail needs to be kept very cold.

"We have to make sure that we send that particular vaccine to the right places, that either have that capacity or the ability to do the dry ice — that we'll need in order to keep it cold," Paul Ostroswki, Perna's civilian deputy, told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin for his "60 Minutes" report.

In September, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company, which has partnered with German biopharmaceuticals firm BioNTech to make the vaccine, was preparing for approval from the federal government and distribution before the end of the year. He said they had already manufactured hundreds of thousands of doses, though he stopped short of predicting when Americans might get access to the vaccine.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a member of Pfizer's board of directors, cautioned on CBS' "Face the Nation" in September, however, that he did not believe a vaccine would be widely available until 2021.

"This is likely to be a very staged market entry," Gottlieb said. "I think that's what people should expect. But for most people, they will not have access to a vaccine until 2021. I think maybe the first quarter of 2021, probably the first half of 2021. And that's assuming that these vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective in these large trials."Pfizer says trials show its COVID vaccine "more than 90% effective""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis," Pfizer CEO says.London — U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said Monday that human trials suggest its coronavirus vaccine is 90% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections in people not known to have had the virus already.

There’s a physical science professor, Thomas Brennan at Ferris State University in Michigan, who went on a surprising rant. He raged about an elite Jewish conspiracy, that the coronavirus is caused by nanotechnology in cell phones, Covid19 is another jewish revolution , that the moon landings were fake, that atom bombs are fake, that the pandemic lockdown is a conspiracy by the Leftist new world over to take over, etc., etc., etc. He has since been placed on leave, although one has to wonder how long this guy was in place on campus, with the other faculty in his discipline looking on. They had to have known!

He was a full-on racist, anti-Semitic, far-right kook with an account on gab and ludicrously awful views about science.

But, you say, what about his side of the story? Maybe he’s got really good, rational arguments to support his views, and would be able to martial an excellent defense in a debate. I got news for you: Brennan wrote a formal letter explaining his position. It really doesn’t help him at all.

This controversy started after I made a few statements in a College of Arts and Sciences

meeting of faculty and staff about the Covid-19 pandemic. My statements were to the

effect that I believe the Covid-19 pandemic is a stunt designed to enslave

humanity and strip us of all of our rights and freedoms.

I don’t believe that the pandemic is a hoax, people have died. But its severity is being

exaggerated by revolutionary leftists in the media and government who ‘never let a good

crisis go to waste.’ The end result of this hysteria, if unchecked, will be a mandatory

vaccine. No one will be allowed into public places or permitted to buy food in a

supermarket unless they present proof-of-vaccination. Initially, this electronic vaccination

certificate will be tied to a person’s smartphone, but will soon after be in the form of

injectable micro or nanotechnology in the vaccine itself. If this comes about it will truly

be a fulfillment of the prophecy of the mark of the beast, as described by St. John the

Apostle in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 13:16-17.

See? Perfectly rational. Bible prophecies are always solid evidence.

Let me address a few of these tweets, starting with the one where I used the ’n-word.’ I

believe the ’n-word’ is a mind-control spell designed to make us hate each

other. I am not racist against black people, I love and respect them. But I

reject the premise that there are certain magic words that should never be used in any

context or by certain people. I uttered the word to try to neutralize its power, and

its implied meaning in the context of the tweet was as a synonym for ‘human being,’ or

‘person,’ since I used it to describe people of different races. I deleted this tweet within a

few hours of typing it back in June 2019, way before I made the Covid-19 comment, so

someone must have screen-shotted it and been building a portfolio to use against me for

when the time came.

It’s all a conspiracy! They’re out to get me!

Ironically, my casual use of the ’n-word’ in that tweet isn’t the most controversial thing

about it. It’s that I’m calling out the huge scientific and historical frauds that I believe

have been perpetrated since the mid-twentieth century. There is real science, but there is

also fake science. Fake science is an instrument of oppression. I believe that Bill Nye,

Buzz Aldrin, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Anthony Fauci are human beings of worth, as we

all are, but I believe they are telling some lies and are a part of a system of lies.

They’re all liars! It’s all fake science!

Besides using the ’n-word,’ a linguistic atom-bomb that I only used to get people’s

attention, I also said ‘Atom Bombs are Fake.’ The atom bomb has got to be one of

the most fear-inducing, oppressive ideas of all time, and ‘fear is the mind-killer.’ After rewatching the footage of atomic bomb tests from the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, it appears to me

they are just films of explosions of large piles of TNT, made to look much bigger through

special effects. By filming an explosion at a high frame-rate and playing it back in slow motion, an impression of immensity can be achieved. Other special-effects techniques

such as ‘front projection,’ ‘forced perspective,’ and superimposed images also seem to

have been used in some of the footage. A combination of these techniques was used to

produce the surprisingly real-looking tornado scene in the 1939 film, the Wizard of Oz.

The best special effects were then, and are still, a military secret, and were only used

sparingly in fictional films of the time to define a false frame of what was real on film.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fire-bombed and flattened overnight with conventional

bombs.

There is much more to the atom bomb deception, but let me move on. I also said: “the

Moon landings are fake.” The films of the Apollo moon landings were faked using

the same special effects bag of tricks that was used to fake the bomb. But the most

powerful argument for why I believe we did not land on the Moon is that the inner solar

system is a blast furnace, and the sun-lit surface of the Moon is over 700 F, not 250 F, as

NASA claims. That is why the Moon glows red during a lunar eclipse—not because of

refracted red light from the Earth’s atmosphere, as Bill Nye and Neil Tyson would have

you believe. The shadow of the Earth’s atmosphere is blue, not red.

He taught physics, let me remind you.

The entire world has fallen under the spell of a satanic, globalist elite. Their end-goal is a

technocratic, one-world government, where everyone, Jew and Gentile, will be

microchipped and tracked 24/7. They use the rhetoric of social-justice and cancel culture, not to bring about equality, but to smear and silence anyone who opposes them.

We will all be equally enslaved if they have their way. They use science, both fake and

real, as a weapon to control us and keep us in a constant state of fear. The fear-spell of

the atom bomb has worn off after all of these years, so they had to unleash a new one,

Covid-19. Lord have mercy on me and on us all.

His intentions are noble and pure, you see.

Don’t you worry about Professor Brennan. He may be about to be fired so hard he’s going to fly out of his socks, but he has a lucrative future ahead of him as a speaker at QAnon rallies and anti-vaxxer conferences, and he’ll probably be invited onto the Joe Rogan show any moment now.Bad professorIt’s always sad to see someone bring disgrace to my profession.

There’s a physical science professor, Thomas Brennan at Ferris State University in Michigan, who went on a surprising rant. He raged about an elite Jewish conspiracy, that the coronavirus is caused by nanotechnology in cell phones, Covid19 is another jewish revolution , that the moon landings were fake, that atom bombs are fake, that the pandemic lockdown is a conspiracy by the Leftist new world over to take over, etc., etc., etc. He has since been placed on leave, although one has to wonder how long this guy was in place on campus, with the other faculty in his discipline looking on. They had to have known!

He was a full-on racist, anti-Semitic, far-right kook with an account on gab and ludicrously awful views about science.

But, you say, what about his side of the story? Maybe he’s got really good, rational arguments to support his views, and would be able to martial an excellent defense in a debate. I got news for you: Brennan wrote a formal letter explaining his position. It really doesn’t help him at all.

This controversy started after I made a few statements in a College of Arts and Sciences

meeting of faculty and staff about the Covid-19 pandemic. My statements were to the

effect that I believe the Covid-19 pandemic is a stunt designed to enslave

humanity and strip us of all of our rights and freedoms.

I don’t believe that the pandemic is a hoax, people have died. But its severity is being

exaggerated by revolutionary leftists in the media and government who ‘never let a good

crisis go to waste.’ The end result of this hysteria, if unchecked, will be a mandatory

vaccine. No one will be allowed into public places or permitted to buy food in a

supermarket unless they present proof-of-vaccination. Initially, this electronic vaccination

certificate will be tied to a person’s smartphone, but will soon after be in the form of

injectable micro or nanotechnology in the vaccine itself. If this comes about it will truly

be a fulfillment of the prophecy of the mark of the beast, as described by St. John the

Apostle in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 13:16-17.

See? Perfectly rational. Bible prophecies are always solid evidence.

Let me address a few of these tweets, starting with the one where I used the ’n-word.’ I

believe the ’n-word’ is a mind-control spell designed to make us hate each

other. I am not racist against black people, I love and respect them. But I

reject the premise that there are certain magic words that should never be used in any

context or by certain people. I uttered the word to try to neutralize its power, and

its implied meaning in the context of the tweet was as a synonym for ‘human being,’ or

‘person,’ since I used it to describe people of different races. I deleted this tweet within a

few hours of typing it back in June 2019, way before I made the Covid-19 comment, so

someone must have screen-shotted it and been building a portfolio to use against me for

when the time came.

It’s all a conspiracy! They’re out to get me!

Ironically, my casual use of the ’n-word’ in that tweet isn’t the most controversial thing

about it. It’s that I’m calling out the huge scientific and historical frauds that I believe

have been perpetrated since the mid-twentieth century. There is real science, but there is

also fake science. Fake science is an instrument of oppression. I believe that Bill Nye,

Buzz Aldrin, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Anthony Fauci are human beings of worth, as we

all are, but I believe they are telling some lies and are a part of a system of lies.

They’re all liars! It’s all fake science!
